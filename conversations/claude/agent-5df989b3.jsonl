I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode for this codebase exploration task.\n\nKey operating parameters I've absorbed:\n\n1. **READ-ONLY CONSTRAINT**: I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files. I can only search and analyze existing code.\n\n2. **Context from CLAUDE.md**: I understand the philosophy of maintaining global perspective, isolating execution details, and precise delegation. However, since I'm in read-only mode, I won't be doing code modifications anyway.\n\n3. **Project Context**: \n   - Working directory: `/Users/yunchang/Documents/GitHub/gemeng2`\n   - Git repo on main branch\n   - Recent activity involves fixes for cross-platform path compatibility\n   - Untracked files: `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.0.md` and migration scripts\n\n4. **My Strengths for This Task**:\n   - Glob patterns for broad file matching\n   - Grep for regex-based code searching\n   - Read for analyzing specific file contents\n   - Bash for read-only operations (ls, git commands, find, cat, etc.)\n\nI'm ready to help you explore and understand this codebase.
