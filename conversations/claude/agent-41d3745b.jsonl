There are also some modified files and new directories (.claude, .mcp.json, mcp-servers/) that appear to be configuration-related.\n\n**What would you like me to help you with today?** Just give me a clear task, and I'll either handle it directly if it's a quick search/analysis, or set up a precise brief for Codex if it needs implementation work."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2535,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"447f212d-93b5-44fa-a6fc-a1226d1c8aaa","timestamp":"2025-12-10T02:38:22.692Z"}
