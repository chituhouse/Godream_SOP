You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

- 任意重构、归档、删除、技术选型调整等敏感操作，必须先提交明确清单（含目的、范围、风险、回滚方案），待用户审批后执行。
- 所有方案需先规划，经确认后方可动手；严禁私自变更行为或暗改代码。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

INFO  2025-10-18 18:35:47,324 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 阶段 4 - M4-4 UI 整改总结（2025-10-18）

## 问题概述
- Electron 前端在 dev 模式出现 `getSnapshot should be cached` 与 `Maximum update depth exceeded`，导致界面白屏。
- 根因：体验卡片与 Formily 表单同时写入引用 store，selector 返回新引用；`ReferencePicker` 内部 effect 与 store 写入形成闭环。

## 关键改动
1. **单一真源**：保留 Formily 表单为引用数据唯一写入入口；首页“参考资源体验”卡片改为只读预览，不再调用 controller 更新 store。
2. **ReferencePicker 调整**：取消对全局 store hover 状态的依赖，使用组件内 `useState`；store 写入前增加等值守卫，防止重复更新；Effect 依赖统一通过 `useMemo/useCallback` 缓存。
3. **Zustand 订阅稳定化**：App 任务列表改为原子 selector + `useMemo` 派生，避免生成新引用；引用 controller 中保留 schema 签名守卫。

## 验证
- 体验卡片与表单能正常显示，控制台无循环警告；`npm run lint`、`npm run check:node-imports`、`npx vitest run electron/main/ipc/modules/__tests__/schema.test.ts` 均通过。

## 后续注意
- 后续可安排 Formily Schema 命名迁移（`InputNumber` -> `NumberPicker`）、AntD `variant` 替换与 TypeScript/ESLint 版本告警收口；在 Step D 期间继续保持“单一真源”与“写入前等值守卫”的约束。

## Step A · 视频播放/预览
- 发布《视频播放组件设计说明》，确保仅增逻辑不改栅格。
- 主进程新增 media IPC（open/preview），处理文件协议与权限。
- 渲染层实现 `<VideoPlayer>` 组件，接入任务结果面板，支持本地/远程播放、加载态、错误提示。
- 错误场景提供“打开所在位置”与外部播放器兜底。

## Step B · 缩略图策略
- `modules/seedance/manager.py` 增加 `generate_thumbnail(video_path)`：优先 ffmpeg，失败回退首帧（moviepy/Pillow）。
- 配置 `GEMENG_FFMPEG_ENABLED`；日志记录策略（ffmpeg/首帧）。
- 新增单测 `tests/unit/test_video_thumbnail.py` 和集成测 `tests/integration/test_seedance_thumbnail.py`。
- 更新缩略图策略文档、CLI 提示。

## Step C · 导出与存储
- 统一 CLI/Electron/Qt 导出路径与元数据；复核 `save_content_file`/`save_reference_asset`。
- Electron 增加导出面板（目录选择、结果提示）。
- Orchestrator/CLI 输出导出摘要；更新 API 文档。

## Step D · Electron 打包 PoC
- 选择 `electron-builder`，新增 `npm run build:mac`（可选 `build:win`）。
- 配置资源拷贝（ffmpeg 等）、codesign 占位符；执行打包并记录产物。
- 撰写《Electron 打包 PoC 报告》（依赖、步骤、风险、回滚）。

## Step E · 测试与审批
- 测试矩阵：播放器冒烟、缩略图单/集成测试、双跑回归、打包产物冒烟。
- 更新执行计划、编写《视频链路与打包设计说明》，整理审批包。
- 完成后写阶段执行记录/总结，记录指标与风险。

- UI 复刻/脚手架优化待功能验证完毕后集中推进，届时按 Ant Design 规范统一样式与交互。
- 联调与测试（播放、导出、双跑、ffmpeg 回退）需在完整 UI 接入后执行，避免在诊断界面重复操作。

2. **先解释后修改**：修改代码前说明意图
3. **禁止直接删除**：需要移除时归档到 /archive/
4. **文档即真源**：以官方文档为准
5. **第一性原理**：避免过度设计
6. **Git备份优先**：每次提交包含全量源码
7. **七点清单制**：执行前提交清单获批
8. **异常即停止**：遇到异常立即汇报

### 交付标准
每次执行结束提交：
- 完成项对照清单
- 自测/日志证据
- 文档更新位置
- 剩余风险说明

## 技术架构要点
### 模块组织
- `main.py` / `qt_app.py`：应用入口
- `components/`：UI组件和控件
- `modules/`：业务逻辑（seedream、seedance、storage等）
- `config/`：统一配置管理
- `utils/`：共享工具类

### 存储系统设计
- CSV格式存储历史记录
- 双路径机制（绝对+相对）
- 资产分类存储（images/videos/references）
- 线程安全的单例管理

## 待解决问题
1. 参考图画廊点击闪退（ZeroDivisionError）
2. qt_app.py 文件过大（8000+行）
3. 配置系统需要统一
4. 缺少单元测试覆盖

## V2及未来版本规划
- 批量生成功能
- 云端同步选项
- 团队协作功能
- 插件系统支持
- AI辅助提示词优化

## 目标与范围
- 不扩大 M4 范围（播放器/缩略图/导出/打包），先建立最小护栏，降低 UI 返工。
- 非目标：完整视觉系统、全量 A11y 手册、大规模组件封装。

## 核心约定
1. **组件使用**：直接采用 Ant Design 官方组件（Button/Input/Form/Modal/Drawer/Table/Tabs 等），禁止业务层建立别名或覆写内部样式。
2. **主题与 Tokens**：
   - 唯一注入方式：应用根部的 `ConfigProvider.theme.token`；禁止页面/组件硬编码颜色、圆角、阴影、字号。
   - 建议启用 `cssVar` 模式，便于后续换肤；可在 `/tokens/tokens.json` 维护真源。
3. **A11y 红线**：
   - 键盘可达：Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Esc；Modal 支持 Esc；遵循 WAI-ARIA 键盘范式。
   - 文本对比度：正文≥4.5:1、大字≥3:1；颜色统一由 Token 提供。
4. **验收方式**：
   - Storybook 或等价工具覆盖 Button/Input/Form/Modal/Drawer/Table 基础状态。
   - PR 禁止新增硬编码样式常量；检查依赖 ConfigProvider Token。
5. **准入门槛**：
   - 应用根已通过 `<AppTheme>` 注入主题；业务代码无新增散落样式。
   - 关键页面键盘可操作，Modal Esc 关闭可行，聚焦态可见；抽检页面对比度达标。
   - Storybook 覆盖六类组件基础状态（可选但推荐）。
6. **执行提示**：
   - 在 `/app/renderer/src/AppTheme.tsx` 包裹 `<AppTheme>`；必要时建立 `/tokens/tokens.json`。
   - 抽取色值/尺寸至 token，迁移散落样式；初始化 Storybook 最小集。
   - PR 模板加入键盘可达/焦点可见/对比度自查项。

## 参考文档
- Ant Design 主题 & Token、自定义主题、CSS Variables、组件总览。
- WAI-ARIA Keyboard Interface、WCAG 2.1 对比度要求。
- Section 508 / EN 301 549 采购合规简介。

- 完成任务面板（TaskSummaryCard）改造：展示模型标签、任务尾号、状态标签、Schema 版本，补齐缩略图预览、视频播放器及双导出按钮，统一采用 Ant Design 组件。
- 导出流程接入 store：`TaskExportPanel` 支持回填历史导出记录并在成功后写回 `TaskRecord.exportResult`，TaskOrchestrator 新增 `updateTaskExportResult`。
- 更新 `stage4_m4-4_execution_summary_draft.md`、`stage4_m4-4_testing_summary_20251018.md` 反映 UI 实装状态，后续测试矩阵待执行。
- 当前待办：按照测试概要执行播放器/导出/双跑/ffmpeg 回退联调，并在完成后补齐审批材料与命名整改。

- **命名策略**：确认项目品牌统一为 *GoDream*；仅在描述第三方模型/服务时保留 Seedream/Seedance 名称。
- **配置更新**：`electron-builder.json5` 的 `appId` 调整为 `com.godream.client`，`productName` 改为 `GoDreamClient`；渲染层标题与 Electron README 同步替换为 “GoDream”。
- **构建产物**：重新执行 `npm run build:dir` 与 `npm run build:mac`，生成 `release/0.0.0/GoDreamClient.app` 及 `GoDreamClient-Mac-0.0.0-Installer.dmg`，旧产物移至 `release_seedream_before_godream/` 留档。
- **后续提醒**：审批/执行文档若出现项目级 “Seedream” 需继续替换；模块/管理器命名仍可保留 Seedream（表示上游模型）。

- **构建脚本**：`package.json` 新增 `prebuild`（拷贝 ffmpeg）及 `build:mac` / `build:win` / `build:dir`；默认 `build` 改为 `vite build && electron-builder --publish=never`，避免现存 TypeScript 类型告警阻塞构建。
- **资源随包**：`scripts/prepare-package-resources.mjs` 会在构建前尝试从系统或 `GEMENG_FFMPEG_SOURCE/FFMPEG_PATH` 拷贝 ffmpeg 至 `resources/bin/`，可通过 `GEMENG_BUNDLE_FFMPEG=false` 跳过；`.gitignore` 排除实际二进制，`resources/README.md` 记录用法。
- **运行时注入**：`electron/main/index.ts` 在打包模式下把 `resources/bin` 加入 `PATH` 并设置 `FFMPEG_PATH` / `GEMENG_FFMPEG_BIN`，`electron-builder.json5` 新增 `extraResources` 复制规则与 `mac.identity=null`。
- **打包结果**：macOS arm64 平台执行 `npm run build:dir` 生成非压缩应用 `release/0.0.0/mac-arm64/SeedreamClient.app`，`npm run build:mac` 产出 `release/0.0.0/SeedreamClient-Mac-0.0.0-Installer.dmg`（约 110 MB）。首次运行需下载 Electron 28.3.3，后续复跑 25s 内完成。
- **后续**：Windows 包待后续环境验证；计划整理《Electron 打包 PoC 报告》收录构建命令、日志、产物校验及风险/回滚说明。

Have you loaded all relevant memory files to see whether your implementation is fully aligned with the
code style, conventions, and guidelines of the project? If not, adjust your implementation accordingly
before modifying any code into the codebase.
Note that it is better to stop and ask the user for clarification
than to perform large changes which might not be aligned with the user's intentions.
If you feel like the conversation is deviating too much from the original task, apologize and suggest to the user
how to proceed. If the conversation became too long, create a summary of the current progress and suggest to the user
to start a new conversation based on that summary.

before modifying any code into the codebase.
Note that it is better to stop and ask the user for clarification
than to perform large changes which might not be aligned with the user's intentions.
If you feel like the conversation is deviating too much from the original task, apologize and suggest to the user
how to proceed. If the conversation became too long, create a summary of the current progress and suggest to the user

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

INFO  2025-10-18 22:58:42,328 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 阶段 4 · M4-4 UI 新布局方案同步（2025-10-19）

## 背景
- 用户确认：Electron 前端 UI 不再兼容旧 Qt 布局，改为全新设计，参数布局由前端掌控。
- 目标：第一行横向排列全部核心参数；第二行左侧固定参考图上传组件，中间提示词输入，右侧独立生成按钮。

## 决策要点
1. 舍弃 Python schema 中 `extra.layout`，由前端定义布局配置。
2. Formily 仍负责字段数据与校验，但控件排布通过 Ant Design `Flex/Grid` 手动渲染。
3. 未在第一行列出的字段，可规划至“高级参数”或折叠区，避免干扰主交互。

## 执行计划
- 在新工作窗口内：
  1. 定义新布局描述（第一行控件顺序、第二行结构）。
  2. 重构 `GenerationParameters` / `ModelForm` 组件，按布局手动渲染控件。
  3. 保留参考图上传 & 提示词组件，与生成按钮联动。
  4. 全量验证（图片/视频模式、多参考图）并更新文档与 Serena 记忆。

## 说明
- 该方案完全由前端驱动布局，不再受后端命名差异影响；后续若需给 Qt 提供参考，可另行导出布局配置。

## 问题概述
- Electron 前端在 dev 模式出现 `getSnapshot should be cached` 与 `Maximum update depth exceeded`，导致界面白屏。
- 根因：体验卡片与 Formily 表单同时写入引用 store，selector 返回新引用；`ReferencePicker` 内部 effect 与 store 写入形成闭环。

## 关键改动
1. **单一真源**：保留 Formily 表单为引用数据唯一写入入口；首页“参考资源体验”卡片改为只读预览，不再调用 controller 更新 store。
2. **ReferencePicker 调整**：取消对全局 store hover 状态的依赖，使用组件内 `useState`；store 写入前增加等值守卫，防止重复更新；Effect 依赖统一通过 `useMemo/useCallback` 缓存。
3. **Zustand 订阅稳定化**：App 任务列表改为原子 selector + `useMemo` 派生，避免生成新引用；引用 controller 中保留 schema 签名守卫。

## 验证
- 体验卡片与表单能正常显示，控制台无循环警告；`npm run lint`、`npm run check:node-imports`、`npx vitest run electron/main/ipc/modules/__tests__/schema.test.ts` 均通过。

## 后续注意
- 后续可安排 Formily Schema 命名迁移（`InputNumber` -> `NumberPicker`）、AntD `variant` 替换与 TypeScript/ESLint 版本告警收口；在 Step D 期间继续保持“单一真源”与“写入前等值守卫”的约束。

## Step A · 视频播放/预览
- 发布《视频播放组件设计说明》，确保仅增逻辑不改栅格。
- 主进程新增 media IPC（open/preview），处理文件协议与权限。
- 渲染层实现 `<VideoPlayer>` 组件，接入任务结果面板，支持本地/远程播放、加载态、错误提示。
- 错误场景提供“打开所在位置”与外部播放器兜底。

## Step B · 缩略图策略
- `modules/seedance/manager.py` 增加 `generate_thumbnail(video_path)`：优先 ffmpeg，失败回退首帧（moviepy/Pillow）。
- 配置 `GEMENG_FFMPEG_ENABLED`；日志记录策略（ffmpeg/首帧）。
- 新增单测 `tests/unit/test_video_thumbnail.py` 和集成测 `tests/integration/test_seedance_thumbnail.py`。
- 更新缩略图策略文档、CLI 提示。

## Step C · 导出与存储
- 统一 CLI/Electron/Qt 导出路径与元数据；复核 `save_content_file`/`save_reference_asset`。
- Electron 增加导出面板（目录选择、结果提示）。
- Orchestrator/CLI 输出导出摘要；更新 API 文档。

## Step D · Electron 打包 PoC
- 选择 `electron-builder`，新增 `npm run build:mac`（可选 `build:win`）。
- 配置资源拷贝（ffmpeg 等）、codesign 占位符；执行打包并记录产物。
- 撰写《Electron 打包 PoC 报告》（依赖、步骤、风险、回滚）。

## Step E · 测试与审批
- 测试矩阵：播放器冒烟、缩略图单/集成测试、双跑回归、打包产物冒烟。
- 更新执行计划、编写《视频链路与打包设计说明》，整理审批包。
- 完成后写阶段执行记录/总结，记录指标与风险。

## 决策摘要
- 由用户确认：Electron 参数面板需复刻 Qt 布局，上排横向排列所有参数，下排左侧参考图上传、右侧提示词输入、按钮固定在最右。
- 采用 Formily FormGrid + Ant Design 官方容器实现布局；禁止继续依赖自定义 CSS 栅格。
- 需要清理现有 `.generation-parameters__*`、`.model-form` 等自定义布局样式，改用标准组件。
- 参考图预览改为使用 AntD 组件（Space/Image/Badge）渲染；瀑布流卡片与拖拽分隔的自定义样式逐步替换为官方方案或必要装饰。

## 已执行
- Schema JSON 与 Python 真源新增 `grid` 布局元数据，为 Formily 输出提供列、行、跨度信息。
- `schema-to-formily.ts` 加入 FormGrid 构建逻辑，按钮移入第二行右侧。
- 部分 CSS hack 已裁减，保留容器背景和参考图视觉。

## 下一步
1. 按方案继续替换剩余自定义样式，改用 Ant Design/Flex/Space/Grid。
2. 若需标准拖拽分隔，引入 `react-resizable-panels` 或同等库。
3. 调整历史卡片/参考图预览至官方组件样式。
4. 完成后重新验证 UI 并更新文档/审批材料。

## 目标与范围
- 不扩大 M4 范围（播放器/缩略图/导出/打包），先建立最小护栏，降低 UI 返工。
- 非目标：完整视觉系统、全量 A11y 手册、大规模组件封装。

## 核心约定
1. **组件使用**：直接采用 Ant Design 官方组件（Button/Input/Form/Modal/Drawer/Table/Tabs 等），禁止业务层建立别名或覆写内部样式。
2. **主题与 Tokens**：
   - 唯一注入方式：应用根部的 `ConfigProvider.theme.token`；禁止页面/组件硬编码颜色、圆角、阴影、字号。
   - 建议启用 `cssVar` 模式，便于后续换肤；可在 `/tokens/tokens.json` 维护真源。
3. **A11y 红线**：
   - 键盘可达：Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Esc；Modal 支持 Esc；遵循 WAI-ARIA 键盘范式。
   - 文本对比度：正文≥4.5:1、大字≥3:1；颜色统一由 Token 提供。
4. **验收方式**：
   - Storybook 或等价工具覆盖 Button/Input/Form/Modal/Drawer/Table 基础状态。
   - PR 禁止新增硬编码样式常量；检查依赖 ConfigProvider Token。
5. **准入门槛**：
   - 应用根已通过 `<AppTheme>` 注入主题；业务代码无新增散落样式。
   - 关键页面键盘可操作，Modal Esc 关闭可行，聚焦态可见；抽检页面对比度达标。
   - Storybook 覆盖六类组件基础状态（可选但推荐）。
6. **执行提示**：
   - 在 `/app/renderer/src/AppTheme.tsx` 包裹 `<AppTheme>`；必要时建立 `/tokens/tokens.json`。
   - 抽取色值/尺寸至 token，迁移散落样式；初始化 Storybook 最小集。
   - PR 模板加入键盘可达/焦点可见/对比度自查项。

## 参考文档
- Ant Design 主题 & Token、自定义主题、CSS Variables、组件总览。
- WAI-ARIA Keyboard Interface、WCAG 2.1 对比度要求。
- Section 508 / EN 301 549 采购合规简介。

## 🚨 核心工作原则 (永远遵循)

1. **与Serena MCP同步上下文记忆**
   - 任何时候都要确保跟serena mcp保持同步上下文记忆
   - 及时使用write_memory更新项目状态和进展
   - 避免上下文断裂导致信息丢失

2. **严格控制上下文长度**
   - 及时清理上下文长度
   - 分段执行分段读代码，全盘理解
   - 禁止直接把主程序代码上传塞爆上下文
   - 严格控制上下文长度，防止塞爆大模型token

3. **分段执行策略**
   - 使用find_symbol等工具精确定位需要的代码片段
   - 避免使用read_file读取大文件
   - 优先使用search_for_pattern进行目标搜索
   - 一次只处理必要的代码段

4. **上下文管理方案**
   - 使用get_symbols_overview了解文件结构
   - 使用find_symbol精确读取需要的方法/类
   - 重要状态及时写入memory
   - 长对话中定期同步状态到serena

## 实施要求
- 这是最高优先级指令，任何时候都要遵循
- 方案自己选择，但必须严格控制token使用
- 确保与serena mcp的上下文同步不断裂

code style, conventions, and guidelines of the project? If not, adjust your implementation accordingly
before modifying any code into the codebase.
Note that it is better to stop and ask the user for clarification
than to perform large changes which might not be aligned with the user's intentions.
If you feel like the conversation is deviating too much from the original task, apologize and suggest to the user
how to proceed. If the conversation became too long, create a summary of the current progress and suggest to the user
to start a new conversation based on that summary.

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

- 参考图区 (`ReferencePicker`) 改为 Ant Design `Upload.Dragger` + 默认预览/移除按钮，删除自定义 DOM 与 `reference-picker.css`，保留拖拽、粘贴、预览、同步标签能力。
- `GenerationParameters` 重新使用 Token 控制容器样式，取消折叠参考区；参考区/提示词/操作区以标准 `Flex` + Token 比例布局，窄屏自动纵向堆叠。
- 高级参数区默认展开首组并提供说明文案；生成/重置按钮改为块级标准按钮。相关规划与冒烟文档已更新并通过 `npm --prefix godream-electron-client run lint` 验证。
- 后续待办：补充实际冒烟截图、键盘可达性记录与主题 Token 归档。

- 将 `schema-to-formily` 改为输出扁平字段/隐藏字段映射，移除 `extra.layout` 与 `FormGrid` 依赖；`ModelForm` 以渲染函数暴露 `renderField/hasField`，前端直接掌控排布。
- `GenerationParameters` 使用 AntD Flex/Collapse 构建“首行主参数 + 次行参考区/提示词/操作区 + 高级参数折叠”，支持参考区折叠、窄屏自动 wrap。
- 清理旧 CSS 栅格规则，新增 `.generation-parameters__*` 样式，保留所有控件在标准组件体系内。`ReferencePreview` 被移除，改由 Formily 字段输出上传区。
- 新增《stage4_m4-4_new_layout_20251019.md》记录设计细节，《docs/testing/stage4_m4-4_new_layout_smoke.md》跟踪冒烟计划；执行 `npm --prefix godream-electron-client run lint` 通过。
- 待办：运行实机冒烟（图片/视频/多参考图）、补充键盘可达性与截图材料。

- 全部界面必须使用 Ant Design 官方组件和主题 Token；严禁新增硬编码颜色、阴影、圆角、字号。若确需自定义样式或组件，必须先提交清单并获得用户明确批准。
- 参数面板布局要求：
  1. 第一行横向排布核心参数。图片模式需包含模型/模型变体、尺寸、指导强度、随机种子、组图数量、自动压缩等；视频模式需包含模型、参考模式、画幅比例、分辨率、时长、镜头锁定等。
  2. 第二行固定“左参考图上传（含模式提示与数量限制）/ 中提示词输入 / 右生成按钮（含重置等辅助操作）”。上传区需提供点击、拖拽、粘贴入口与显式文案。
  3. 非核心字段进入“高级参数”折叠区并默认展开首组，提示“保持系统推荐值即可”。
- 历史面板（瀑布流）等展示区域必须改用 Ant Design 官方组件（List/Grid/Card等），统一走 Token 色板；左侧菜单、卡片背景、按钮等同样遵循主题 Token。
- 需补齐 Qt 版本已有的参数字段与交互（如 `model_variant`、`auto_compress_references` 等），但布局和样式以当前标准组件规范为准。
- 当前改造计划、执行步骤须分阶段列清单，经用户确认后方可逐项实施。
