You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

## 状态概览
- M4-3 全部交付完成：Formily 常量、任务调度 Orchestrator、CLI 提示增强、真实双跑指标与审批包均已归档。
- M4-4 准备完成：安全基线合入 (`nodeIntegration:false`、`contextIsolation:true`、`sandbox:true`)，preload 无 Node 依赖；缩略图策略约束落档；UI 一页纸护栏生效。

## 快检记录
- 缩略图冒烟：`VideoThumbnailGenerator` 仍能生成缩略图（日志输出 `thumb_generate` 摘要），确认安全改动不阻碍链路。
- Serena 记忆：`阶段执行_阶段4_M4-3收尾_20251018`、`阶段执行_阶段4_M4-4_开工前规划_20251018`、`设计系统_最小UI协作规范_20251018` 均同步。

## 下一步
- 按计划启动 M4-4 Step A（播放器设计与实现），后续执行依赖该检查点状态。

- 资源：前端/后端执行窗口、证书与打包环境、CI/CD 权限。

## 注意事项
- 执行窗口需使用 Serena MCP 工具，遵循 `docs/window_startup_checklist.md`。
- 任何代码迁移前，先完成 PoC 与审批，确保可回滚。
- 若在执行中发现 Electron 无法满足特定能力，立即停止并汇报，等待决策。

INFO  2025-10-19 03:12:56,445 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 阶段 4 - M4-4 执行动作（2025-10-18）

## Step A · 视频播放/预览
- 发布《视频播放组件设计说明》，确保仅增逻辑不改栅格。
- 主进程新增 media IPC（open/preview），处理文件协议与权限。
- 渲染层实现 `<VideoPlayer>` 组件，接入任务结果面板，支持本地/远程播放、加载态、错误提示。
- 错误场景提供“打开所在位置”与外部播放器兜底。

## Step B · 缩略图策略
- `modules/seedance/manager.py` 增加 `generate_thumbnail(video_path)`：优先 ffmpeg，失败回退首帧（moviepy/Pillow）。
- 配置 `GEMENG_FFMPEG_ENABLED`；日志记录策略（ffmpeg/首帧）。
- 新增单测 `tests/unit/test_video_thumbnail.py` 和集成测 `tests/integration/test_seedance_thumbnail.py`。
- 更新缩略图策略文档、CLI 提示。

## Step C · 导出与存储
- 统一 CLI/Electron/Qt 导出路径与元数据；复核 `save_content_file`/`save_reference_asset`。
- Electron 增加导出面板（目录选择、结果提示）。
- Orchestrator/CLI 输出导出摘要；更新 API 文档。

## Step D · Electron 打包 PoC
- 选择 `electron-builder`，新增 `npm run build:mac`（可选 `build:win`）。
- 配置资源拷贝（ffmpeg 等）、codesign 占位符；执行打包并记录产物。
- 撰写《Electron 打包 PoC 报告》（依赖、步骤、风险、回滚）。

## Step E · 测试与审批
- 测试矩阵：播放器冒烟、缩略图单/集成测试、双跑回归、打包产物冒烟。
- 更新执行计划、编写《视频链路与打包设计说明》，整理审批包。
- 完成后写阶段执行记录/总结，记录指标与风险。

Have you loaded all relevant memory files to see whether your implementation is fully aligned with the
code style, conventions, and guidelines of the project? If not, adjust your implementation accordingly
before modifying any code into the codebase.
Note that it is better to stop and ask the user for clarification
than to perform large changes which might not be aligned with the user's intentions.
If you feel like the conversation is deviating too much from the original task, apologize and suggest to the user
how to proceed. If the conversation became too long, create a summary of the current progress and suggest to the user
to start a new conversation based on that summary.

- 现有前端界面排布（布局结构、模块位置）视为基准，未经用户书面确认不得调整；组件样式可优化但需保持原有布局比例。
- 任意重构、归档、删除、技术选型调整等敏感操作，必须先提交明确清单（含目的、范围、风险、回滚方案），待用户审批后执行。
- 所有方案需先规划，经确认后方可动手；严禁私自变更行为或暗改代码。
- 优先以 Serena MCP 工具完成全局审视与规划，确保跨会话时第一时间读取该指示。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

- 参考图区 (`ReferencePicker`) 改为 Ant Design `Upload.Dragger` + 默认预览/移除按钮，删除自定义 DOM 与 `reference-picker.css`，保留拖拽、粘贴、预览、同步标签能力。
- `GenerationParameters` 重新使用 Token 控制容器样式，取消折叠参考区；参考区/提示词/操作区以标准 `Flex` + Token 比例布局，窄屏自动纵向堆叠。
- 高级参数区默认展开首组并提供说明文案；生成/重置按钮改为块级标准按钮。相关规划与冒烟文档已更新并通过 `npm --prefix godream-electron-client run lint` 验证。
- 后续待办：补充实际冒烟截图、键盘可达性记录与主题 Token 归档。

## 🚨 核心工作原则 (永远遵循)

1. **与Serena MCP同步上下文记忆**
   - 任何时候都要确保跟serena mcp保持同步上下文记忆
   - 及时使用write_memory更新项目状态和进展
   - 避免上下文断裂导致信息丢失

2. **严格控制上下文长度**
   - 及时清理上下文长度
   - 分段执行分段读代码，全盘理解
   - 禁止直接把主程序代码上传塞爆上下文
   - 严格控制上下文长度，防止塞爆大模型token

3. **分段执行策略**
   - 使用find_symbol等工具精确定位需要的代码片段
   - 避免使用read_file读取大文件
   - 优先使用search_for_pattern进行目标搜索
   - 一次只处理必要的代码段

4. **上下文管理方案**
   - 使用get_symbols_overview了解文件结构
   - 使用find_symbol精确读取需要的方法/类
   - 重要状态及时写入memory
   - 长对话中定期同步状态到serena

## 实施要求
- 这是最高优先级指令，任何时候都要遵循
- 方案自己选择，但必须严格控制token使用
- 确保与serena mcp的上下文同步不断裂

- `taskOrchestrator.updateTaskFromEnvelope` 中接收 `storage_local.root`，若 `outputPath/thumbnailPath` 非绝对路径则自动拼接存储根；同时保留 `thumbnail_relative_path` 与策略字段。
- 后续在前端调用 `media.preview/open/reveal` 前即可拿到受信路径，解决“文件不在受信路径”错误，为缩略图/播放器铺路。
- 分支逻辑不触碰参数栏/UI 布局，仅修正媒体链路。

- 新增 `utils/media.ts`，统一封装 `previewMedia/openMedia/revealMedia` 调用 Electron `media.*` IPC。
- `GenerationGallery` 支持缩略图预览加载（请求 preview API 并缓存），并在卡片内提供“打开文件/显示位置”快捷操作。
- `TaskDetailModal` 加入缩略图预览图像、调用按钮与错误提示，通过 API 打通内容打开与定位链路。

- **算法配置**：在 `src/main.tsx` 的 `ConfigProvider` 中启用 `theme.darkAlgorithm`（保留可选 `cssVar` 钩子），确保基础暗色对比度由 Ant Design 算法处理。
- **Token 调整**：
  - 核心 Token：`colorPrimary/#5B8CFF`、`colorInfo/#5B8CFF`、`colorSuccess/#22C55E`、`colorWarning/#F59E0B`、`colorError/#EF4444`。
  - 暗色扩展 Token：保留 `colorBgBase/#11141C`、`colorBgContainer/#181D29`、`colorBgElevated/#1F2535`、`colorBorderSecondary/rgba(123,144,255,0.16)` 等；根据需要增加 `colorBgLayout`、`colorTextSecondary` 明确值。
- **组件级覆盖**：
  - `Dropdown/Select/Input/Upload`：设置背景/边框继承暗色 Token，移除 `.parameter-card__body` 定制。
  - `Switch`：`colorPrimary`、`colorPrimaryHover` 对齐主色；`Menu` 选中态使用 `colorPrimary` 半透明渐变。
  - `Typography/Form/Collapse/Button`：保留现有配置，但迁移到 `theme.components` 与 Token，避免 CSS 覆写。
- **执行节点**：
  1. 调整 Token + `theme.components`，替换 CSS 覆写。
  2. 运行 `npm --prefix godream-electron-client run lint` 并进行 UI 冒烟。
  3. 向 Serena 提交“暗色 Token 调整完成”记录，附对照表与截图摘要，获确认后再进行模型/面板后续步骤。

- **生成内容无法打开**：当前前端组件未调用 `window.api.media.preview/open`，任务详情仅显示路径；需规划如何触发预览与本地打开，并确认 Python 端 envelope 已返回合法路径。
- **任务状态提示**：Gallery/Detail 仅用文字展示状态，缺少明显 loading；可引入 AntD `Spin`/`Skeleton` 等标准组件，在 `PENDING/RUNNING` 阶段提供动效提示。
- **下拉背景透明**：虽然 Token 已配置，实际 dropdown 仍透明；需在 DevTools 中确认 CSS 变量注入情况，必要时在 ConfigProvider 或少量 CSS 中为 `.ant-select-dropdown` 固定背景（例如 `colorBgElevated`）。

## 目标
在 Electron 设置页提供统一的“应用设置”模块，支持一次性配置存储目录和 API Key，并将配置写入后端（AppConfig / 环境变量），使统一存储与密钥管理生效。

## 前端改动
- Settings 面板新增“应用设置”卡片，包含：
  1. **存储目录**：文本框展示当前目录，旁边有“选择目录…”按钮；支持手动编辑。
  2. **API Key**：密码输入框（占位符显示 `••••`），不回显真实值，仅用于输入或覆盖。
- 底部单一“保存设置”按钮；提交后一次性调用 IPC `settings:apply`，将目录与 Key 一并发送。
- 初始化时调用 `settings:get-config`，获取 `{ storageDir, storageIsCustom, apiKeyConfigured }`，据此初始化表单状态。
- “选择目录…”使用 `settings:choose-storage` 打开系统对话框，结果填入文本框。
- 成功保存后展示 `message.success`，并响应 `settings:storage-updated` 事件刷新历史记录 / 任务列表。

## Electron 主进程
- 新增 IPC：
  - `settings:get-config` → 返回当前存储目录、是否自定义、API Key 是否已设置。
  - `settings:choose-storage` → 调用 `dialog.showOpenDialog({ properties: ['openDirectory'] })`。
  - `settings:apply` → 接收 `{ storageDir?: string, apiKey?: string | null }`，内部逻辑：
    1. 若 `storageDir` 存在：使用 `AppConfig` 更新 `creation.storage_root_path` 并设 `use_custom_storage=true`，调用 `get_storage_dir()` 校验并自动创建目录。
    2. 若 `apiKey` 提交：写入后端安全存储（例如 `.env`、凭据文件或 `AppConfig` 的字段），不回传明文。
    3. 成功后广播 `settings:storage-updated` 给渲染进程。
- 错误时返回 `{ success: false, message }`，前端展示提醒。

## Python / 后端
- `config_api.get_storage_dir()` 已支持自定义路径，无需额外改动。
- 追加 `set_api_key(service, key)` 或使用原有凭据写入逻辑，保存后供 Seedream/Seedance 客户端读取。
- 接收到 `settings:storage-updated` 后可选刷新缓存或提示重启（通过 Electron 消息或日志）。

## 开发提示
- 保存成功后建议提示用户“继续生成前请重启应用或刷新任务列表”，确保仓库指向新目录。
- API Key 输入后即刻清空前端状态，`apiKeyConfigured` 布尔值用于显示“已设置”徽标。
- 目录为空表示不修改；如需恢复默认，可在后续版本补充“恢复默认”按钮，目前按需求忽略。

> 以上规划未触动参数栏 / 主题等已冻结区域，仅新增设置模块与 IPC。执行时需同步 Serena 记录每一步。

2. **后端 API 归一化**：整理 Python 服务接口，统一请求/响应格式与错误码。
3. **任务调度与 Schema 表单选型**：比较 Formily/JSON Forms，设计 IPC 与任务管理策略。
4. **视频链路补全**：验证视频播放、缩略图、导出、日志链路在 Electron 下的实现。
5. **打包与多平台验证**：构建打包流程（含签名）、自动更新、安全策略、多平台冒烟测试。
6. **性能与监控体系**：搭建前端性能/错误监控，扩展 CI/CD 流程覆盖测试与发布。

## 里程碑
- M4-1：前端工程基础与组件规范完成。
- M4-2：后端 API 归一化方案与 PoC 通过。
- M4-3：任务调度与 Schema 表单选型确定并完成 PoC。
- M4-4：视频链路与打包流程 PoC 通过。
- M4-5：性能/错误监控与 CI/CD 流水线初版上线。

每个里程碑需：
- 写入 Serena 阶段总结。
- 提交设计/PoC 文档与风险清单。
- 明确回滚方案。

## 审批与依赖
- 阶段 3 总结与技术路线决策已获批准。
- 执行前需审批各项方案（前端栈、API 归一化、任务/表单、视频链路、打包、监控）。
- 资源：前端/后端执行窗口、证书与打包环境、CI/CD 权限。

## 注意事项
- 执行窗口需使用 Serena MCP 工具，遵循 `docs/window_startup_checklist.md`。
- 任何代码迁移前，先完成 PoC 与审批，确保可回滚。
- 若在执行中发现 Electron 无法满足特定能力，立即停止并汇报，等待决策。

## 实施内容
- 新增 `tools/settings_cli.py`，集中封装配置操作：
  - `get-config`：返回当前存储根目录（含自定义标记）与 API Key 配置状态。
  - `apply`：从 STDIN 读取 JSON 负载，按需更新自定义存储路径（创建目录 + 写入 AppConfig）与火山引擎 API Key（写入凭据文件）。
  - 默认强制 `LOGURU_LEVEL=ERROR`、`GEMENG_STORAGE_DEBUG=0`，避免调试日志干扰 IPC。
- Electron 主进程新增 `ipc/modules/settings.ts`：
  - `settings:get-config` 调用 CLI 获取摘要。
  - `settings:choose-storage` 调用系统目录对话框。
  - `settings:apply` 校验入参（Zod），通过 CLI 落库后同步 `process.env`，并在存储更新时广播 `settings:storage-updated` 事件。
- `shared/ipc-types.ts` / `electron/preload/index.ts` 扩展 `BridgeApi.settings`，包含配置摘要、目录选择与应用接口。
- 运行 `npm --prefix godream-electron-client run lint` ✅。

## 影响
- Electron 端现具备读取/写入自定义存储目录与 API Key 的底层能力，后续前端设置页可直接调用。
- 所有更新均通过 CLI 同步至 AppConfig/credentials.json，保持与 Python 端工具链的真源一致。
- 存储目录更新后会广播事件，供历史列表等模块触发刷新。

## 组件
- 新增 `src/components/settings/ApplicationSettingsCard.tsx`：
  - 加载 `settings:get-config` 初始化表单（存储目录、API Key 状态），展示自定义目录标记。
  - 支持“选择目录…”对话框（IPC `settings:choose-storage`）与手动编辑。
  - 单一“保存设置”按钮调用 `settings:apply`，成功后提示目录/密钥更新结果并建议重启。
  - 监听 `settings:storage-updated` 广播，外部更新时自动刷新表单。

## App 页面
- `settings` 标签页结构调整：顶部展示 `ApplicationSettingsCard`，下方保留“系统诊断”卡片（原 ping 功能），整体沿用暗色 Token 样式。
- 移除旧的 `Title` 文案，Card 标题化管理模块文案。

## 校验
- `npm --prefix godream-electron-client run lint` ✅。
- CLI/IPC 已于前序阶段落地，本次仅对接 UI，无额外后端改动。

## 检查要点
- `RepositoryManager.get_records()` 返回的记录已附带 `storage_root`，`absolute_path` 与 `thumbnail_path` 均为绝对路径（python 快速抽样验证）。
- 现有 CLI `settings_cli.py` 在不改动目录的情况下返回 `storage_updated=false`，确保不会误触自定义目录；目录与密钥更新均会透传到 Electron 主进程。

## 待线下确认
- 需在 GUI 中以新生成任务实际点击“预览/打开”做一次冒烟，确认 Electron IPC + 媒体授权放宽链路表现正常；当前数据面已满足受信路径要求。

## 目的
为历史记录提供受信根目录与绝对路径，解决旧任务缩略图/主文件仅返回相对路径导致前端无法预览的问题。

## 实施
- `modules/repository/manager.py::_normalize_record`
  - 统一读取 `metadata_manager.root_path`（失败时回落到实例 `storage_root`），新增 `storage_root` 字段并始终返回绝对路径字符串。
  - 针对 `resolved_path/absolute_path/local_path/file_path`/`relative_path` 做路径归一：优先识别远程 URL，其余若为相对路径则拼接根目录并 `resolve()`，保持 `relative_path` 为 POSIX 风格（`/` 分隔）。
  - 缩略图字段在保留原有相对值的同时新增 `thumbnail_relative_path`，并为本地文件补齐绝对路径/本地路径，兼容远程 URL。
- 通过 `python3 -m compileall modules/repository/manager.py` 验证语法正确。

## 影响
- `RepositoryManager.get_records/get_records_batch/search_content` 等返回的记录现包含 `storage_root` 与可用绝对路径，前端可直接调用 `media.preview/open/reveal`。
- 导出服务 `export_generation_bundle` 可复用同一数据，无需额外修改；后续阶段仍需在仓库 CLI/导出冒烟中验证旧记录兼容情况。

## 目标
在 Electron 设置页提供统一的“应用设置”模块，支持一次性配置存储目录和 API Key，并将配置写入后端（AppConfig / 环境变量），使统一存储与密钥管理生效。

## 前端改动
- Settings 面板新增“应用设置”卡片，包含：
  1. **存储目录**：文本框展示当前目录，旁边有“选择目录…”按钮；支持手动编辑。
  2. **API Key**：密码输入框（占位符显示 `••••`），不回显真实值，仅用于输入或覆盖。
- 底部单一“保存设置”按钮；提交后一次性调用 IPC `settings:apply`，将目录与 Key 一并发送。
- 初始化时调用 `settings:get-config`，获取 `{ storageDir, storageIsCustom, apiKeyConfigured }`，据此初始化表单状态。
- “选择目录…”使用 `settings:choose-storage` 打开系统对话框，结果填入文本框。
- 成功保存后展示 `message.success`，并响应 `settings:storage-updated` 事件刷新历史记录 / 任务列表。

## Electron 主进程
- 新增 IPC：
  - `settings:get-config` → 返回当前存储目录、是否自定义、API Key 是否已设置。
  - `settings:choose-storage` → 调用 `dialog.showOpenDialog({ properties: ['openDirectory'] })`。
  - `settings:apply` → 接收 `{ storageDir?: string, apiKey?: string | null }`，内部逻辑：
    1. 若 `storageDir` 存在：使用 `AppConfig` 更新 `creation.storage_root_path` 并设 `use_custom_storage=true`，调用 `get_storage_dir()` 校验并自动创建目录。
    2. 若 `apiKey` 提交：写入后端安全存储（例如 `.env`、凭据文件或 `AppConfig` 的字段），不回传明文。
    3. 成功后广播 `settings:storage-updated` 给渲染进程。
- 错误时返回 `{ success: false, message }`，前端展示提醒。

## Python / 后端
- `config_api.get_storage_dir()` 已支持自定义路径，无需额外改动。
- 追加 `set_api_key(service, key)` 或使用原有凭据写入逻辑，保存后供 Seedream/Seedance 客户端读取。
- 接收到 `settings:storage-updated` 后可选刷新缓存或提示重启（通过 Electron 消息或日志）。

## 开发提示
- 保存成功后建议提示用户“继续生成前请重启应用或刷新任务列表”，确保仓库指向新目录。
- API Key 输入后即刻清空前端状态，`apiKeyConfigured` 布尔值用于显示“已设置”徽标。
- 目录为空表示不修改；如需恢复默认，可在后续版本补充“恢复默认”按钮，目前按需求忽略。

> 以上规划未触动参数栏 / 主题等已冻结区域，仅新增设置模块与 IPC。执行时需同步 Serena 记录每一步。

## 🚨 核心工作原则 (永远遵循)

1. **与Serena MCP同步上下文记忆**
   - 任何时候都要确保跟serena mcp保持同步上下文记忆
   - 及时使用write_memory更新项目状态和进展
   - 避免上下文断裂导致信息丢失

2. **严格控制上下文长度**
   - 及时清理上下文长度
   - 分段执行分段读代码，全盘理解
   - 禁止直接把主程序代码上传塞爆上下文
   - 严格控制上下文长度，防止塞爆大模型token

3. **分段执行策略**
   - 使用find_symbol等工具精确定位需要的代码片段
   - 避免使用read_file读取大文件
   - 优先使用search_for_pattern进行目标搜索
   - 一次只处理必要的代码段

4. **上下文管理方案**
   - 使用get_symbols_overview了解文件结构
   - 使用find_symbol精确读取需要的方法/类
   - 重要状态及时写入memory
   - 长对话中定期同步状态到serena

## 实施要求
- 这是最高优先级指令，任何时候都要遵循
- 方案自己选择，但必须严格控制token使用
- 确保与serena mcp的上下文同步不断裂

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

角色：我审批；你（Codex）推理/规划与执行；Serena 仅是工具箱（定位/检索/记忆/补丁），不自主决策。
路线选择（先回答并给理由+风险）：
- Fix TODO：入口明确、单文件、≤50 行、无需跨文件检索/重构。
- Serena：入口不清/影响多文件/需调用链或重构；或单步 >50 行/总改动需分步（单步 ≤300 行）。
禁止：未说明理由的大范围 read_file / shell 扫库；任何暗改。

Serena 路线（强制工具化）：
1) 定位：find_symbol / get_symbols_overview / search_for_pattern / find_referencing_symbols → 输出文件+行号+片段+候选入口排序。
2) /plan（不执行）：每步写 目标/改动点/副作用/验收/最小回滚（单步 ≤300 行）。获批后分步执行；每步复盘 ≤5 行。
3) 关键取舍用 write_memory 写“决策卡”（背景→选项→取舍→影响面→回滚点）。

Fix TODO 路线（微改）：
- 只改 TODO 邻近代码，不调用 Serena，不跨文件；先列改动点/估行数/副作用 → 给差异预览待批。
- 发现需跨文件或 >50 行，立刻停下改走 Serena。
提交：Conventional Commit + 2 行回滚说明。上下文：长对话前先 6 行小结再继续。

开场动作（跨会话同步）：
- 读取 Serena(global) 中《Codex↔Serena 协作约定》与最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述后再 /plan。

INFO  2025-10-19 06:57:38,057 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 阶段交接：历史记录与多图生成规划（2025-10-19）

## 当前状态
- **检查点**：`检查点_生图生视频功能实现_缩略图与记录正常_20251019` 已建立，表明 Seedream / Seedance 生成链路、缩略图展示、设置页 IPC 均正常，RepositoryManager 已补齐 `storage_root` 与绝对路径。
- **设置模块**：`tools/settings_cli.py` + `settings:get-config/choose-storage/apply` IPC 已落地，前端 `ApplicationSettingsCard` 可读取/保存目录和 API Key，并广播 `settings:storage-updated`。
- **媒体预览**：Electron 端走统一 `media.preview/open/reveal`，受信路径校验放宽后新任务可直接预览。

## 待处理关键点
1. **历史记录加载**
   - 旧目录 `/Users/yunchang/Desktop/测试` 中仍有大量未显示的记录；原因在于旧 CSV 只有相对路径，需要通过 `tools/storage_migration.py` 迁移到 V2.1 标准，并在 Electron 端实现 `history:list` IPC 读取。
   - 前端需监听 `settings:storage-updated` 后自动刷新历史列表，展示迁移后的绝对路径数据。
2. **多图生成**
   - “生成数量”字段尚未驱动后端循环；需恢复 Qt 时代逻辑：前端透传 `group_count`（或同义字段），SeedreamManager 按数量触发多次请求并落地 `_0/_1/...`，CSV 记录同步更新。

## 建议执行序列
1. 核对 Formily schema 字段 → 恢复 `group_count` 循环生成 → 实测 3 张图片落地。
2. 编写 `history_cli.py`（或等效模块）+ 注册 `history:list` IPC → 提供分页结果给前端。
3. 设置页保存成功后触发 `storage_migration.py`（可先 dry-run），迁移完成再广播刷新 → 前端拉取历史并处理缺失文件提示。
4. 记录每个阶段执行情况，按“完成 → Serena 验证 → 下一步”节奏推进。

> 测试与验证一律以 `/Users/yunchang/Desktop/测试` 为根目录执行，确保历史数据与新记录共存场景可复现。
