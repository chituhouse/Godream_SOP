You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

## 当前完成项

### ✅ Step1-2 完成
- git嵌套问题已解决
- tools/integrate_adapters.py 成功执行，导入了 HistoryViewAdapter 和 ReferenceImagesAdapter
- qt_app.py 语法错误（line 40）已修复，适配器导入位置正确
- 组件测试工具验证成功启动

### 🎯 用户明确要求
- **只替换组件，不要更改UI界面**
- 刚才测试是组件功能测试，不是界面重构
- 需要与Serena MCP配合，管理上下文

## 待执行核心任务

### 🚨 紧急修复项
1. **样式系统集成**：使用 tools/style_migration_tool.py 修复qt_app.py中300+硬编码font-size
2. **字体缩放响应性**：验证系统缩放功能是否正常工作
3. **组件替换确认**：确保Day4优化组件实际被使用（OptimizedHistoryModel等）

### 📋 Day4问题诊断结果
- qt_app.py (9075行) 有86处硬编码font-size覆盖了统一样式系统
- 瀑布流和下拉菜单部分替换成功，但标题等UI元素缩放不生效
- Day4性能优化(545x提升)开发完成但集成不完整

## 技术策略
- **方案C**: 最小化修复，保持现有UI结构
- **双入口保持**: python3 qt_app.py 继续有效
- **工具导向**: 使用现有自动化工具安全修复

INFO  2025-09-25 14:30:04,433 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # Day4字体系统全面排查报告

## 问题确认

### 1. 快捷键问题根因 ⭐ 最关键
**发现位置**: qt_app.py第8638-8647行
- ✅ Windows/Linux: `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, `Ctrl+0` 已配置
- ❌ Mac系统: **完全缺失**`Cmd++`, `Cmd+-`, `Cmd+0` 快捷键配置

**这就是用户在Mac上按Cmd++没有反应的根本原因！**

### 2. 非标准字体组件排查结果
- ✅ **参数栏**: SchemaFormRenderer使用标准Qt组件(QComboBox, QSpinBox等)
- ❌ **历史记录区域**: components/cards/video_card.py使用硬编码`font-size: {DpiScaler.px(12)}px`
- ❌ **qt_app.py主文件**: 86处硬编码font-size覆盖统一样式系统

### 3. Day4完成状态
- ✅ 性能优化组件(OptimizedHistoryModel等)已开发完成
- ❌ 样式系统集成不完整，硬编码问题阻止字体缩放生效
- ✅ 样式迁移工具(tools/style_migration_tool.py)已准备就绪

## 修复方案(4阶段)

### 阶段1: 紧急修复Mac快捷键 🚨
```python
# qt_app.py第8638行附近添加Mac快捷键支持
import platform
if platform.system() == "Darwin":  # Mac系统
    zoom_in_mac1 = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd++"), self)
    zoom_in_mac2 = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+="), self) 
    zoom_out_mac = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+-"), self)
    zoom_reset_mac = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+0"), self)
    # 连接到相同的字体缩放方法
```

### 阶段2: 执行样式迁移工具
```bash
# 预演模式
python tools/style_migration_tool.py --dry-run
# 实际修复
python tools/style_migration_tool.py
```

### 阶段3: 修复历史记录区域字体
替换components/cards/video_card.py中的硬编码font-size

### 阶段4: 验证系统响应性
测试Mac/Windows快捷键功能和统一样式系统覆盖效果

## 技术细节
- 字体缩放工具: utils/font_scaler.py (已集成统一样式系统)
- 样式迁移工具: tools/style_migration_tool.py (可自动修复86处硬编码)
- 统一样式系统: utils/style_system.py (支持全局字体缩放)

## 优先级建议
1. **立即修复**: Mac快捷键配置(阻止用户使用字体缩放)
2. **高优先级**: 执行样式迁移工具(解决86处硬编码问题)
3. **中等优先级**: 历史记录区域字体标准化
4. **最终验证**: 系统响应性测试

- 组件测试工具验证成功启动

### 🎯 用户明确要求
- **只替换组件，不要更改UI界面**
- 刚才测试是组件功能测试，不是界面重构
- 需要与Serena MCP配合，管理上下文

## 待执行核心任务

### 🚨 紧急修复项
1. **样式系统集成**：使用 tools/style_migration_tool.py 修复qt_app.py中300+硬编码font-size
2. **字体缩放响应性**：验证系统缩放功能是否正常工作
3. **组件替换确认**：确保Day4优化组件实际被使用（OptimizedHistoryModel等）

### 📋 Day4问题诊断结果
- qt_app.py (9075行) 有86处硬编码font-size覆盖了统一样式系统
- 瀑布流和下拉菜单部分替换成功，但标题等UI元素缩放不生效
- Day4性能优化(545x提升)开发完成但集成不完整

## 技术策略
- **方案C**: 最小化修复，保持现有UI结构
- **双入口保持**: python3 qt_app.py 继续有效
- **工具导向**: 使用现有自动化工具安全修复

INFO  2025-09-25 14:40:05,300 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # Day4字体系统全面排查报告

## 问题确认

### 1. 快捷键问题根因 ⭐ 最关键
**发现位置**: qt_app.py第8638-8647行
- ✅ Windows/Linux: `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, `Ctrl+0` 已配置
- ❌ Mac系统: **完全缺失**`Cmd++`, `Cmd+-`, `Cmd+0` 快捷键配置

**这就是用户在Mac上按Cmd++没有反应的根本原因！**

### 2. 非标准字体组件排查结果
- ✅ **参数栏**: SchemaFormRenderer使用标准Qt组件(QComboBox, QSpinBox等)
- ❌ **历史记录区域**: components/cards/video_card.py使用硬编码`font-size: {DpiScaler.px(12)}px`
- ❌ **qt_app.py主文件**: 86处硬编码font-size覆盖统一样式系统

### 3. Day4完成状态
- ✅ 性能优化组件(OptimizedHistoryModel等)已开发完成
- ❌ 样式系统集成不完整，硬编码问题阻止字体缩放生效
- ✅ 样式迁移工具(tools/style_migration_tool.py)已准备就绪

## 修复方案(4阶段)

### 阶段1: 紧急修复Mac快捷键 🚨
```python
# qt_app.py第8638行附近添加Mac快捷键支持
import platform
if platform.system() == "Darwin":  # Mac系统
    zoom_in_mac1 = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd++"), self)
    zoom_in_mac2 = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+="), self) 
    zoom_out_mac = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+-"), self)
    zoom_reset_mac = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+0"), self)
    # 连接到相同的字体缩放方法
```

### 阶段2: 执行样式迁移工具
```bash
# 预演模式
python tools/style_migration_tool.py --dry-run
# 实际修复
python tools/style_migration_tool.py
```

### 阶段3: 修复历史记录区域字体
替换components/cards/video_card.py中的硬编码font-size

### 阶段4: 验证系统响应性
测试Mac/Windows快捷键功能和统一样式系统覆盖效果

## 技术细节
- 字体缩放工具: utils/font_scaler.py (已集成统一样式系统)
- 样式迁移工具: tools/style_migration_tool.py (可自动修复86处硬编码)
- 统一样式系统: utils/style_system.py (支持全局字体缩放)

## 优先级建议
1. **立即修复**: Mac快捷键配置(阻止用户使用字体缩放)
2. **高优先级**: 执行样式迁移工具(解决86处硬编码问题)
3. **中等优先级**: 历史记录区域字体标准化
4. **最终验证**: 系统响应性测试

## 🚨 核心冲突确认

### 新旧组件混用问题
**qt_app.py中的矛盾状态：**
- 第40行：导入Day4新适配器 `HistoryViewAdapter, ReferenceImagesAdapter` ✅
- 第4487行：定义旧的内嵌 `WaterfallWidget` 类 ❌
- 第5060行：图片历史实际使用 `self.waterfall_widget = WaterfallWidget()` ❌ 旧组件
- 第6562行：视频历史实际使用 `self.video_waterfall_widget = WaterfallWidget()` ❌ 旧组件

### 用户反馈的具体表现
- 组件生效不稳定：有时候是标准组件，有时候又不是
- 视频历史记录瀑布流看起来跟图片的不一样
- 字体缩放功能时好时坏

### 技术分析
**Day4适配器特点（新组件）：**
- 使用OptimizedHistoryModel（545x性能提升）
- 标准Qt组件，支持统一字体缩放
- 现代化API：add_item, clear_items, refresh
- 标准信号系统：itemClicked, refreshRequested

**旧WaterfallWidget特点（qt_app.py内嵌）：**
- 内嵌在主程序中，9000+行代码臃肿
- 可能包含硬编码样式（虽然已被样式迁移工具处理）
- 性能较低，没有优化
- API不统一

### 根本冲突原因
1. **双重定义**：新适配器导入了但没有使用
2. **实际调用旧组件**：waterfall_widget仍使用内嵌的旧类
3. **不同渲染逻辑**：新旧组件的渲染机制不同
4. **样式应用不一致**：新组件支持统一样式，旧组件可能不支持

### 解决方案核心
必须彻底替换qt_app.py中的旧WaterfallWidget调用为新的HistoryViewAdapter

## 问题确认

### 1. 快捷键问题根因 ⭐ 最关键
**发现位置**: qt_app.py第8638-8647行
- ✅ Windows/Linux: `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, `Ctrl+0` 已配置
- ❌ Mac系统: **完全缺失**`Cmd++`, `Cmd+-`, `Cmd+0` 快捷键配置

**这就是用户在Mac上按Cmd++没有反应的根本原因！**

### 2. 非标准字体组件排查结果
- ✅ **参数栏**: SchemaFormRenderer使用标准Qt组件(QComboBox, QSpinBox等)
- ❌ **历史记录区域**: components/cards/video_card.py使用硬编码`font-size: {DpiScaler.px(12)}px`
- ❌ **qt_app.py主文件**: 86处硬编码font-size覆盖统一样式系统

### 3. Day4完成状态
- ✅ 性能优化组件(OptimizedHistoryModel等)已开发完成
- ❌ 样式系统集成不完整，硬编码问题阻止字体缩放生效
- ✅ 样式迁移工具(tools/style_migration_tool.py)已准备就绪

## 修复方案(4阶段)

### 阶段1: 紧急修复Mac快捷键 🚨
```python
# qt_app.py第8638行附近添加Mac快捷键支持
import platform
if platform.system() == "Darwin":  # Mac系统
    zoom_in_mac1 = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd++"), self)
    zoom_in_mac2 = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+="), self) 
    zoom_out_mac = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+-"), self)
    zoom_reset_mac = QShortcut(QKeySequence("Cmd+0"), self)
    # 连接到相同的字体缩放方法
```

### 阶段2: 执行样式迁移工具
```bash
# 预演模式
python tools/style_migration_tool.py --dry-run
# 实际修复
python tools/style_migration_tool.py
```

### 阶段3: 修复历史记录区域字体
替换components/cards/video_card.py中的硬编码font-size

### 阶段4: 验证系统响应性
测试Mac/Windows快捷键功能和统一样式系统覆盖效果

## 技术细节
- 字体缩放工具: utils/font_scaler.py (已集成统一样式系统)
- 样式迁移工具: tools/style_migration_tool.py (可自动修复86处硬编码)
- 统一样式系统: utils/style_system.py (支持全局字体缩放)
