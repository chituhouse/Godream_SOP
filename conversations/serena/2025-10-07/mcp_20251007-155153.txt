You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

than to perform large changes which might not be aligned with the user's intentions.
If you feel like the conversation is deviating too much from the original task, apologize and suggest to the user
how to proceed. If the conversation became too long, create a summary of the current progress and suggest to the user
to start a new conversation based on that summary.

INFO  2025-10-07 16:50:07,319 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # qt_app.py重构计划 - 第一性原理分析

## 核心问题
- qt_app.py有8000+行代码
- 一次性读取会导致API上下文爆炸
- 需要真正的模块化拆分，而不是打补丁

## 第一性原理分析

### 问题本质
1. **单体文件过大**：所有功能耦合在一个文件中
2. **API限制**：Claude的上下文窗口有限
3. **需求**：真正的代码重构，不是表面修改

### 解决思路
1. **符号级操作**：使用Serena的find_symbol工具，按功能定位代码
2. **增量提取**：每次只提取一个功能模块（200-500行）
3. **记忆管理**：将提取进度保存到Serena记忆中
4. **并行工作**：创建新文件的同时，保持旧文件运行

## 具体方案

### Phase 1: 符号分析（使用Serena）
```python
# 使用Serena的工具分析qt_app.py的结构
get_symbols_overview('qt_app.py')  # 获取所有类和函数列表
find_symbol('MainWindow', include_body=False)  # 分析主窗口结构
```

### Phase 2: 功能模块识别
基于符号分析，识别独立功能模块：
1. 图片生成模块（~1500行）
2. 视频生成模块（~1500行）
3. 设置模块（~800行）
4. 历史记录模块（~1200行）
5. UI布局模块（~1000行）
6. 工具函数（~2000行）

### Phase 3: 增量提取策略
每次提取一个模块：

**Step 1: 提取图片生成模块**
```python
# 使用Serena定位
find_symbol('generate_image', include_body=True)
find_symbol('handle_image_response', include_body=True)
find_referencing_symbols('generate_image', 'qt_app.py')
```

**Step 2: 创建独立模块文件**
```python
# modules/ui/image_generation.py
class ImageGenerationModule:
    # 提取的代码
```

**Step 3: 创建导入桥接**
```python
# qt_app_new.py (逐步构建)
from modules.ui.image_generation import ImageGenerationModule
```

### Phase 4: 渐进式替换
1. 保持qt_app.py不变
2. 创建qt_app_new.py逐步构建
3. 测试每个模块
4. 最后切换

## Serena工具链使用

### 可用工具
1. **get_symbols_overview** - 获取文件结构概览
2. **find_symbol** - 精准定位函数/类
3. **find_referencing_symbols** - 查找依赖关系
4. **replace_symbol_body** - 替换函数体
5. **insert_after_symbol** - 插入新代码

### 记忆管理
- 每提取一个模块，保存进度到Serena记忆
- 记录依赖关系图
- 保存重构状态

## 执行计划

### Day 1（2小时）
1. 符号分析 - 30分钟
2. 提取图片生成模块 - 90分钟

### Day 2（2小时）
1. 提取视频生成模块 - 90分钟
2. 提取设置模块 - 30分钟

### Day 3（2小时）
1. 提取历史记录模块 - 60分钟
2. 整合测试 - 60分钟

### Day 4（1小时）
1. 切换到新架构 - 30分钟
2. 性能优化 - 30分钟

## 风险控制
1. **备份**：cp qt_app.py qt_app_backup_20250924.py
2. **并行开发**：新旧代码并存
3. **增量测试**：每个模块独立测试
4. **回退机制**：随时可切换回原版

## 预期成果
- qt_app.py（8000行）拆分为：
  - modules/ui/image_generation.py（1500行）
  - modules/ui/video_generation.py（1500行）
  - modules/ui/settings.py（800行）
  - modules/ui/history.py（1200行）
  - modules/ui/layout.py（1000行）
  - modules/ui/helpers.py（2000行）
  - qt_app_new.py（主框架，500行）

## 关键点
1. **不读取整个文件**：使用Serena的符号工具
2. **增量工作**：每次处理200-500行
3. **保持运行**：旧代码继续工作
4. **真正重构**：不是表面修改，是结构性改变

2. **modules.seedance**: 视频生成API
3. **modules.storage**: 存储管理
4. **modules.repository**: 数据仓库
5. **components**: UI组件
6. **utils**: 工具函数

### 内部依赖
- MainWindow → ImageModeWidget, VideoModeWidget
- ImageModeWidget → WaterfallWidget, ImageGenerationThread
- VideoModeWidget → WaterfallWidget, VideoGenerationThread

## 重构策略调整

基于实际代码分析，建议调整重构策略：

### Phase 1: 辅助组件提取（1-4966行）
1. 卡片组件（ImageCard, VideoCard）
2. 对话框组件（ImageDetailDialog, VideoDetailDialog）
3. 瀑布流组件（WaterfallWidget）
4. 参考图组件（ReferenceGalleryWidget）
5. 工具函数

### Phase 2: 核心模块提取
1. ImageModeWidget（1500行）
2. VideoModeWidget（2000行）
3. MainWindow（400行）

### Phase 3: 新架构组装
- 创建模块化主程序
- 建立依赖注入
- 配置通信机制

## 关键发现

1. **代码高度相似**：ImageModeWidget和VideoModeWidget有大量重复代码
2. **组件耦合度高**：瀑布流、历史记录等功能嵌入在Widget中
3. **可重用性低**：很多功能可以抽象为独立组件
4. **分离点明确**：各个类边界清晰，便于提取

## 风险评估

- **低风险**：辅助组件提取（独立性高）
- **中风险**：核心Widget提取（依赖较多）
- **高风险**：MainWindow重构（涉及整体架构）

## 执行优先级

1. **立即可做**：提取辅助组件（ImageCard等）
2. **次优先级**：提取ImageModeWidget
3. **再次优先**：提取VideoModeWidget
4. **最后执行**：重构MainWindow

- **阶段现状**：
  - 阶段1（启动修复）已完成。
  - 阶段2（Manager 层集成）未启动：Seedream/Seedance/GLM 管理器仍使用旧式文件保存；需接入 `modules/storage/unified_storage_manager_v2`。
  - 阶段3（UI 数据绑定）未启动：历史瀑布流、参考图角标、ZIP 导出尚未对接统一存储输出。
  - 阶段4（端到端测试）未开展。
- **工作量评估**：
  - 阶段2：中高。涉及 manager、repository、多线程下载路径改写，需保证双路径存储及回写。
  - 阶段3：中。需在不改 UI 布局前提下更新 model 数据来源、详情/导出逻辑。
  - 阶段4：中。构建端到端脚本与手动场景验证。
- **技术风险**：
  - `qt_app.py` 体量大，改动易引发回归；需按模块拆解、充分备份。
  - 存储切换可能影响已有历史数据兼容性（需迁移策略）。
  - 线程/异步文件写入需防止 UI 卡顿与资源泄漏。
- **最高原则约束**：
  - UI 排布不可改动，可替换组件但禁止整体重构。
  - 按第一性原理解决根因，避免表层补丁。
- **建议顺序**：
  1. 梳理 manager -> storage 调用链，设计双路径落盘与历史回读方案。
  2. 在保持现有界面的前提下接入统一存储输出，确保历史/导出/参考图功能复用。
  3. 准备端到端测试清单与脚本，覆盖图像/视频/项目切换。

- 扩展 `UnifiedStorageManagerV2`：
  - 新增 CSV 辅助方法、`save_video_metadata`、`update_record`、`get_record_by_task_id`、`search_records`、`get_dataframe` 等接口，兼容原 `metadata_manager` 调用。
  - 更新 `_apply_updates_to_video_record` 以同步 `local_path`、缩略图路径、视频 URL 等元数据，保持双路径信息。
- `download_completed_video` 现复用 `_save_video_locally`（内部调用 `save_content_file`），避免旧的 `save_file` 接口；下载后通过 `update_record` 写回本地路径、缩略图、文件大小等信息。
- 通过脚本验证：
  - `save_content_file` → `save_video_metadata` → `update_record` → `get_record_by_task_id` 流程可获得 `local_path`、`video_url` 等数据；
  - `search_records('input_image', ...)` 能检索记录；`get_dataframe` 能返回 DataFrame（pandas 存在时）。
- 风险&待办：
  - 缩略图/API 备份仍依赖 `requests`，需在无网络场景下提供兜底策略；
  - 旧 CSV 中缺失的扩展字段（如 `local_file_size`）将逐步写入，阶段 2.5 需评估一次性迁移脚本；
  - GLMManager 仍引用旧 metadata 接口，待阶段 2.3 统一接入。

- 更新 `modules/storage/unified_storage_manager_v2.py`：
  - `save_content_file` 现返回 `absolute_path`、`local_path`，保持旧字段兼容；写入 CSV 后仍使用 V2.1 字段。
  - `save_reference_asset` 增加 `absolute_path`、`local_path`，并将 `type/kind/source/order/width/height` 等元数据提升为顶层字段，满足 `SeedreamManager`、导出工具的路径需求。
- 通过脚本验证：
  - `save_content_file` 正常写入测试目录并返回路径别名。
  - `_process_reference_assets` 在 sample base64 输入下写入参考图，返回的资产列表包含所需字段。
- 剩余风险：
  - 旧目录数据需在阶段 2.5 统一评估迁移；
  - SeedanceManager/GLMManager 尚未切换，历史记录读取仍部分依赖旧结构。

- `UnifiedStorageManagerV2` 新增聊天专用能力：
  - `CHAT_FIELDS` 与聊天 CSV 管理、历史 JSON 存储路径 (`chats/history`).
  - `save_chat_session`/`load_chat_session`/`list_chat_sessions`/`delete_chat_session`。
  - `add_record`/`update_record`/`get_record_by_task_id`/`get_recent_records` 对 `glm_session` 类型自动路由到聊天存储。
  - `search_records`、`get_dataframe` 支持 `chats` 模式，兼容统计场景。
- `GLMManager` 改造：
  - 初始化时将 `storage_path` 指向统一聊天目录；
  - `load_session`、`_save_session`、`list_sessions`、`delete_session` 等操作全部使用统一存储接口，自动维护消息计数、系统提示等元数据；
  - 兼容旧版历史：若未找到记录，将 legacy `glm` 目录下 JSON 自动迁移。
- 验证：
  - 通过脚本创建→保存→加载→列出→删除会话，全流程在统一存储下成功运行。
  - 会话列表可正确返回 `session_id` / `updated_at` / `message_count` 等字段。
- 风险 & 后续：
  - 老版本遗留的 `glm/*.json` 会在首次加载时迁移，但仍需阶段 2.5 统一迁移脚本确保批量兼容。
  - 与 API 的真实交互尚未执行，后续可在端到端测试阶段使用测试 API Key 验证完整链路。

- 背景：仓储 CSV 中 `reference_assets` 一直为空，导致历史卡片和详情页都没有参考图展示。
- 原因：在 `MainWindow.setup_ui` 中将 `self.video_reference_panel` 设为 `None`，参考图面板未被实例化，也没有收集到用户选择的文件。
- 措施：
  1. 在 `setup_ui` 恢复 `ReferenceAssetsPanel` 的创建、事件连接与 `input_layout.addWidget`。
  2. 保持原有的校验/裁剪逻辑（`_collect_reference_assets_for_video`、`_refresh_video_reference_panel_state`）可正常工作。
- 预期结果：
  - 用户选择参考图后，`self.current_generation_params['reference_assets']` 以及 `result['reference_assets']` 将包含实际数据。
  - 仓储写入后，视频历史卡片会显示角标，详情页也能看到参考图列表。

- 进一步处理：`VideoGenerationThread` 支持 `data/url` 形式的参考图，避免仅有 base64 时被过滤。

7. Schema 表单行距、控件间距会随 font_scale 调整，避免拥挤。
8. Serena 已同步阶段规划、虚拟化待办等关键记忆。
9. 待执行跨平台缩放 + 参考图流程测试。
10. 后续完成后需要更新 Serena 小结及相关文档。
