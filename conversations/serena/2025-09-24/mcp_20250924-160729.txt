You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

## Day 3 规划：集成新组件到qt_app

### 核心任务
1. 创建GenerationWidgetAdapter适配器
2. 更新qt_app.py引用（lines 4968-8540）
3. 保证向后兼容
4. 集成测试

### 上下文管理策略
- 使用Serena的find_symbol精准定位
- 每次只处理200-500行
- 避免读取整个qt_app.py

### 具体步骤

#### Step 1: 创建适配器（30分钟）
```python
# components/adapters/generation_adapter.py
- 映射旧接口到新组件
- 信号转发
- 方法代理
```

#### Step 2: 定位qt_app中的引用（30分钟）
```python
# 使用Serena查找
find_symbol('ImageModeWidget', 'qt_app.py')
find_symbol('VideoModeWidget', 'qt_app.py')
```

#### Step 3: 替换引用（1小时）
- MainWindow.__init__中的组件创建
- setup_mode_buttons中的切换逻辑
- 信号连接部分

#### Step 4: 测试验证（30分钟）
- 创建test_integration.py
- 验证新旧功能一致性

### 风险点
1. qt_app.py有8930行，需要精准操作
2. 保持API兼容性
3. 信号名称映射

### 预期结果
- qt_app.py减少约1000行
- 新组件无缝集成
- 所有功能正常工作

INFO  2025-09-24 18:07:40,767 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # UI组件标准化重构进展 - 2025年9月24日

## 重构背景
- 原有系统存在255个硬编码样式问题
- 字体缩放精度不够，响应不灵敏
- 历史记录无法处理大量数据（10000+条）
- 组件设计过度复杂，维护困难

## 第一阶段：字体系统深度重构（已完成）

### 1. 增强的UnifiedStyleSystem (utils/style_system.py)
- 智能组件类型识别（支持20+种Qt组件）
- 样式继承机制
- 主题色管理集成
- 递归应用样式到子组件
- 自动识别组件类型并应用相应样式

### 2. 优化的FontScaler (utils/font_scaler.py)
- 智能舍入算法（阈值0.3）
- 多级缓存（LRU）
- 50ms防抖延迟应用
- 递归处理所有子组件
- 精度从70-200%提升到50-200%

### 3. 样式迁移工具 (tools/style_migration_tool.py)
- 自动扫描硬编码样式
- 生成迁移报告
- 批量替换功能
- 找到并分类了255个样式问题

### 4. 组件清理示例 (components/creation_components.py)
- 移除23个硬编码尺寸设置
- 集成统一样式系统调用

## 第二阶段：组件标准化（进行中）

### 1. 历史记录虚拟化 ✅
**OptimizedHistoryModel (components/models/history_model_optimized.py)**
- 虚拟化数据管理，支持10000+条记录
- LRU缓存（500个缩略图）
- 批量操作支持
- 内存占用减少90%

**OptimizedHistoryView (components/views/history_view_optimized.py)**
- 瀑布流布局
- 虚拟化滚动
- 批量渲染（每批50个）
- 搜索过滤功能
- 右键菜单操作

### 2. 参考图组件简化 ✅
**ReferenceImagesWidget (components/widgets/reference_images_simple.py)**
- 使用标准QListWidget（放弃Model/View）
- 支持拖拽排序
- 外部文件拖入
- 最多10张限制
- 缩略图120px显示

### 3. 参数表单标准化 ✅
**ParameterFormWidget (components/forms/parameter_form_standard.py)**
- 使用QFormLayout自动布局
- 支持7种输入类型（int/float/str/text/bool/select/slider）
- 参数分组显示
- 300ms防抖更新
- 动态参数配置

### 4. 集成测试工具 ✅
**ComponentTestWindow (tools/test_component_integration.py)**
- 测试10000条历史记录性能
- 验证参考图拖拽功能
- 参数表单动态切换（V3/V4模式）
- 实时字体缩放测试
- 性能监控（内存/FPS）

## 架构改进

### 第一性原理分析
- Model/View仅用于历史记录（数千条数据）
- 参数输入直接使用Qt标准组件
- 参考图使用简单QListWidget（最多10张）
- 避免过度设计，减少代码复杂度83%

### 性能优化
- 虚拟化渲染：只创建可见UI元素
- 批量处理：每批50-500条记录
- 缓存策略：LRU缓存热点数据
- 防抖机制：减少不必要的更新

## 关键技术突破

1. **虚拟化技术**
   - QListView.setUniformItemSizes(True)
   - QListView.setLayoutMode(Batched)
   - 只渲染viewport内的项目

2. **智能样式系统**
   - isinstance链式判断组件类型
   - 样式继承和覆盖机制
   - 递归应用到所有子组件

3. **精准字体缩放**
