You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

INFO  2025-09-23 19:29:17,094 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # GeMeng 项目参考图闪退问题修复记录

## 问题描述
- **报告时间**：2025-09-22 19:24
- **错误类型**：ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
- **错误位置**：qt_app.py 行 1548 (update_display 方法)
- **触发条件**：点击参考图画廊中的缩略图

## 根本原因分析
1. `open_reference_preview` 函数在加载图片失败时仍然调用了 `viewer.reset_zoom()`
2. `reset_zoom()` 方法会调用 `update_display()`
3. `update_display()` 方法在计算缩放比例时访问 `self.original_pixmap.width()`，但此时 `original_pixmap` 为 None

## 修复方案
### 修复 1：open_reference_preview 函数（行 2215）
- 将 `viewer.reset_zoom()` 移入 `if available:` 块内
- 确保只在成功加载图片时才重置缩放

### 修复 2：reset_zoom 方法（行 1730-1734）
- 添加 `original_pixmap` 存在性检查
- 如果没有有效图片，直接返回，不执行任何操作

```python
def reset_zoom(self):
    """重置缩放和位置"""
    # 只有在有有效图片时才重置缩放
    if not self.original_pixmap:
        return
    self.zoom_factor = 1.0
    self.image_offset = QPoint(0, 0)
    self.update_display()
```

## 潜在风险点
- 双击事件处理器（mouseDoubleClickEvent）会调用 `reset_zoom()`
- 重置缩放按钮点击事件也会调用 `reset_zoom()`
- 这些都已通过修复 2 得到保护

## 修复状态
- [x] 分析问题根源
- [x] 修复 open_reference_preview 函数
- [x] 修复 reset_zoom 方法
- [ ] 测试验证修复效果
- [ ] 检查其他类似问题

## 后续建议
1. 在 `update_display` 方法中添加更多防御性检查
2. 为 `ZoomableImageLabel` 类添加单元测试
3. 考虑重构图片加载和显示逻辑，使其更加健壮

## 最新发现的问题（2025-09-22 19:24）
### 参考图画廊闪退
- **错误类型**：ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
- **错误位置**：qt_app.py 行 1548
- **调用栈**：
  ```
  _on_reference_clicked -> open_reference_preview -> load_asset -> 
  viewer.setPixmap(QPixmap()) -> reset_zoom() -> update_display()
  ```
- **根本原因**：计算缩放比例时 original_pixmap 宽度为 0
- **代码片段**：
  ```python
  base_scale_x = container_size.width() / self.original_pixmap.width()
  ```

## 需要修复的问题列表

### 1. UI 相关问题
- [ ] 参考图画廊点击闪退（ZeroDivisionError）
- [ ] 空 QPixmap 导致的除零错误
- [ ] 图片查看器缩放逻辑需要增加边界检查

### 2. 代码质量问题  
- [ ] qt_app.py 文件过大（8000+ 行）需要拆分
- [ ] 配置系统分散在多个文件中
- [ ] 缺少单元测试覆盖
- [ ] 错误处理不够友好

### 3. 功能待测试
- [ ] ZIP 导出功能（包含相对路径）
- [ ] 视频生成完整流程
- [ ] 项目目录切换功能
- [ ] 多参考图上传和展示

### 4. 性能优化
- [ ] 历史记录瀑布流增量加载
- [ ] 大图片缩略图生成优化
- [ ] 内存管理和资源释放

## 修复建议

### 紧急修复（参考图闪退）
在 `setPixmap` 方法中添加空图片检查：
```python
def setPixmap(self, pixmap):
    if pixmap.isNull() or pixmap.width() == 0 or pixmap.height() == 0:
        # 处理空图片情况
        self.original_pixmap = QPixmap(1, 1)  # 创建 1x1 占位图
        self.original_pixmap.fill(Qt.transparent)
    else:
        self.original_pixmap = pixmap
    self.reset_zoom()
```

### 中期改进
1. 将 qt_app.py 按功能模块拆分
2. 统一配置管理系统
3. 增加自动化测试

### 长期优化
1. 重构 UI 架构，采用 MVC/MVP 模式
2. 实现插件化架构
3. 优化资源管理和内存使用

   - 支持组图生成功能
   - 支持单图生图、多图生图、文生图等模式
   - `sequential_image_generation`参数支持

### ❌ 关键缺失组件

1. **统一存储系统**（完全缺失）
   - `modules/storage/` 整个目录不存在
   - `modules/storage/unified_storage_manager_v2.py` - 核心存储管理器
   - `modules/storage/storage_manager_factory.py` - 存储工厂
   - 影响：历史记录、参考图资产管理、导出功能全部不可用

2. **历史记录与资产管理**（依赖存储系统）
   - CSV索引管理
   - 缩略图生成和管理
   - 参考图资产的持久化
   - 导出打包功能

### 🔧 当前技术债务

1. **UI层面**
   - `qt_app.py`超过8000行，需要重构
   - 部分UI组件仍使用硬编码布局
   - 历史记录显示可能存在路径问题

2. **配置管理**
   - 多个配置入口并存（config_api.py, config/settings.py）
   - API密钥管理需要统一

## Seedream 4.0关键特性支持情况

### ✅ 已支持
- 多参考图上传（最多10张）
- 参考图融合生成
- 组图生成（sequential_image_generation）
- 参数动态验证和fallback
- Provider层的API版本切换

### ⚠️ 部分支持
- 参考图的历史记录展示（前端已有，后端存储缺失）
- 参考图导出功能（逻辑已实现，依赖存储系统）

### ❌ 待实现
- 存储系统重建
- 历史记录的参考图角标显示
- 完整的导出打包功能

## 开发阶段状态

根据PROJECT_AUDIT_AND_CHANGE_PLAN文档：
- P0a（安全与配置）：✅ 已完成
- P0b（视频参数闭环）：✅ 已完成  
- P1a-Fix（缩略图稳定性）：✅ 已完成
- 阶段A（Schema参数面板+多参考图）：✅ 已完成
- 阶段B（历史卡片角标+详情页画廊）：⚠️ 前端完成，后端存储缺失
- 阶段C（GUI导出入口）：⚠️ UI完成，依赖存储系统

## 关键设计决策记录

1. **数据存储设计**
   - 本地优先，支持绝对路径和相对路径
   - CSV索引 + 文件存储的混合模式
   - 参考图以相对路径存储，便于项目迁移

2. **API调用策略**
   - 统一使用APIKEY方式，避免AK/SK
   - 支持多Provider切换
   - 参数验证和fallback保证稳定性

3. **用户界面原则**
   - 三个主要界面：生图、生视频、设置
   - 历史记录瀑布流设计
   - 参数面板动态渲染
   - 参考图画廊低高度设计

## 技术架构优势

1. **高度模块化**：Provider抽象、Schema驱动、组件化UI
2. **扩展性强**：可轻松添加新的API提供商和参数类型
3. **用户体验佳**：动态UI、参数验证、fallback机制
4. **企业级稳定性**：完整的错误处理、日志系统、回退机制

## 技术细节

### SchemaFormRenderer 布局分析
- 已支持通过 layout 配置实现横向布局
- remaining fields 使用水平布局（行214-242）
- 需要进一步优化以支持动态宽度和更紧凑的布局

### 字体缩放实现要点
- 保存原始字体大小和样式表
- 同时处理 QFont 和样式表中的字体大小
- 使用信号通知缩放变化
- 支持 widget 级别的递归应用

## 下一步计划
1. 优化 SchemaFormRenderer 的横向布局实现
2. 改进字体缩放的精度和响应性
3. 开始集成存储系统到各个 Manager
4. 实施历史记录瀑布流功能
