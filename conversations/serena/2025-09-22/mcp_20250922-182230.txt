You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

## 当前状态总结

### ✅ 已完成的关键发现
1. **核心功能完整**：Seedream 4.0、多参考图、Provider架构全部实现
2. **根本问题明确**：`modules/storage/`目录完全缺失，影响32个文件导入
3. **测试数据可用**：用户桌面测试文件夹有完整的V2存储系统实例
4. **用户需求明确**：要求新增relative_path字段，支持项目根目录切换

### 🎯 用户核心要求
- **项目为中心**：支持根目录切换后自动加载历史记录
- **向后兼容**：旧记录必须能读取并自动添加relative_path字段
- **双路径策略**：同时保存绝对路径和相对路径
- **无损迁移**：切换根目录不丢失任何历史数据

## 技术实施方案

### Phase 1: 存储系统核心重建 (P0)
```
modules/storage/
├── __init__.py                          # 导出get_v2_storage_manager
├── storage_manager_factory.py          # 工厂模式+缓存
└── unified_storage_manager_v2.py       # 核心存储管理器
```

**关键接口**:
```python
class UnifiedStorageManagerV2:
    def save_content_file(content_type, file_data, url, metadata) -> dict
    def save_reference_asset(content_type, file_data, asset_id, ext, metadata) -> dict  
    def load_history(content_type, limit=50) -> List[dict]
    def migrate_legacy_records(root_path) -> int  # 关键：旧记录兼容
    def get_storage_stats() -> dict
```

### Phase 2: CSV Schema升级 (P0)
- **现有18字段基础上确保relative_path字段存在**
- **智能兼容**：读取优先relative_path，fallback到file_path
- **自动迁移**：检测到旧CSV时自动添加relative_path列并填充

### Phase 3: Manager层集成 (P1)
- **无缝接入**：现有manager继续通过工厂获取存储实例
- **零API变更**：保持现有调用签名不变
- **渐进式迁移**：支持新旧存储系统共存

## 核心业务逻辑

### 路径解析策略
```python
def resolve_file_path(record: dict, storage_root: str) -> str:
    # 1. 优先使用relative_path
    if record.get('relative_path'):
        return os.path.join(storage_root, record['relative_path'])
    
    # 2. fallback到file_path并推导relative_path
    elif record.get('file_path'):
        abs_path = record['file_path']
        try:
            rel_path = os.path.relpath(abs_path, storage_root)
            # 可选：回写relative_path到CSV实现渐进式迁移
            return abs_path if os.path.exists(abs_path) else None
        except ValueError:
            return abs_path if os.path.exists(abs_path) else None
    
    return None
```

### 旧记录迁移逻辑
```python
def migrate_legacy_records(csv_path: str, storage_root: str) -> int:
    # 1. 检测CSV是否有relative_path列
    # 2. 如无则添加列
    # 3. 遍历file_path不为空但relative_path为空的记录
    # 4. 计算相对路径并回写
    # 5. 返回迁移记录数
```

## 关键业务场景验证

### 场景1: 新用户使用
- ✅ 选择根目录 → 生成内容 → 自动写入双路径 → 历史正常显示

### 场景2: 切换项目目录  
- ✅ 选择新根目录 → 读取relative_path → 自动拼接路径 → 历史无缝切换

### 场景3: 导入旧项目
- ✅ 选择旧目录 → 检测缺失relative_path → 自动迁移 → 生成相对路径

## 实施时间线

- Day 3-4: 导出功能路径处理
- Day 5: 用户验收测试

## 风险评估

### 高风险
- **数据安全**：旧记录迁移可能出错
  - 缓解：迁移前自动备份CSV
  - 回滚：保持file_path字段，可随时回退

### 中风险  
- **性能影响**：大量历史记录迁移耗时
  - 缓解：批量处理，只在首次访问时迁移
  - 监控：记录迁移进度和失败计数

### 低风险
- **路径兼容性**：跨平台路径分隔符
  - 缓解：统一使用os.path.join和相对路径

## 验收标准

INFO  2025-09-22 18:26:34,063 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 存储系统相对路径设计决策与实施方案

## 核心设计原则

### 1. 项目为中心的存储架构
- **目标**: 支持根目录切换后自动加载当前项目历史记录
- **实现**: CSV新增`relative_path`字段，同时保持`file_path`（绝对路径）向后兼容
- **用户价值**: 项目可在不同设备间迁移，无需手动重新配置路径

### 2. 双路径存储策略
- **新记录**: 同时写入`relative_path`和`file_path`两个字段
- **读取优先级**: 优先读取`relative_path`，缺失时回退到`file_path`并推导相对路径
- **兼容性**: 旧CSV记录仅有`file_path`的情况下，自动生成`relative_path`并回写

### 3. 旧记录兼容机制
**关键需求**（用户明确要求）：
```
向旧的记录做兼容，如果发现旧记录没有相对路径字段，
要主动读旧的绝对路径，同时为旧的内容生成新的相对路径字段
```

**实施策略**:
- 检测CSV是否有`relative_path`列，如无则添加
- 遍历所有`file_path`为空的`relative_path`记录
- 基于当前根目录和绝对路径计算相对路径
- 回写CSV，保证向后兼容

## 技术实现方案

### CSV Schema v2.1升级
```csv
# 原18字段基础上确保relative_path字段存在
file_id,generation_id,prompt,file_path,filename,content_type,width,height,duration,file_size,model,created_at,status,parameters,source_url,thumbnail_path,batch_info,metadata,relative_path
```

### 核心接口设计
```python
class UnifiedStorageManagerV2:
    def save_content_file(self, content_type: str, file_data: bytes, url: str, metadata: dict) -> dict:
        # 保存时同时写入绝对路径和相对路径
        pass
        
    def load_history(self, content_type: str, limit: int = 50) -> List[dict]:
        # 读取时优先使用relative_path，自动兼容旧记录
        pass
        
    def migrate_legacy_records(self, root_path: str) -> int:
        # 为旧记录生成relative_path字段
        pass
```

### 路径解析逻辑
```python
def resolve_file_path(record: dict, storage_root: str) -> str:
    """智能路径解析：优先相对路径，兼容绝对路径"""
    if record.get('relative_path'):
        return os.path.join(storage_root, record['relative_path'])
    elif record.get('file_path'):
        # 旧记录兼容：尝试推导相对路径
        abs_path = record['file_path']
        try:
            rel_path = os.path.relpath(abs_path, storage_root)
            # 可选：回写relative_path到CSV
            return abs_path if os.path.exists(abs_path) else None
        except:
            return abs_path if os.path.exists(abs_path) else None
    return None
```

## 关键业务场景

### 场景1: 新用户首次使用
- 用户选择存储根目录
- 生成内容时自动写入相对路径和绝对路径
- 历史记录正常显示

### 场景2: 用户切换项目目录
- 用户在设置页选择新的根目录
- 系统读取新目录下的CSV索引
- 基于相对路径自动拼接文件路径
- 历史记录无缝切换

### 场景3: 导入旧项目数据
- 用户选择包含旧CSV的目录作为根目录
- 系统检测到缺失relative_path字段
- 自动执行migrate_legacy_records()迁移
- 为所有旧记录生成相对路径并回写CSV

## 实施优先级

### P0 - 核心存储系统重建
1. 创建modules/storage/目录结构
2. 实现UnifiedStorageManagerV2核心接口
3. 添加relative_path字段支持
4. 实现旧记录自动迁移逻辑

### P1 - 历史记录集成
1. 更新manager层调用存储接口
2. 修复历史记录瀑布流显示
3. 测试路径切换功能

### P2 - 参考图资产管理
1. 参考图relative_path支持
2. 导出功能中的路径处理
3. UI层相对路径显示

## 风险评估与缓解

### 风险1: 旧数据损坏
- **缓解**: 迁移前自动备份原CSV
- **回滚**: 保留file_path字段，可随时回退

### 风险2: 路径推导失败
- **缓解**: 推导失败时保持原绝对路径
- **监控**: 记录推导失败的记录数量

### 风险3: 性能影响
- **缓解**: 迁移只在首次访问旧目录时执行
- **优化**: 批量处理，避免逐条回写

## 验收标准

1. ✅ 新生成内容包含relative_path字段
2. ✅ 旧CSV自动添加relative_path列
3. ✅ 路径切换后历史记录正常显示
4. ✅ 文件实际存在性验证通过
5. ✅ 迁移过程无数据丢失
6. ✅ UI显示相对路径，避免敏感信息泄露
