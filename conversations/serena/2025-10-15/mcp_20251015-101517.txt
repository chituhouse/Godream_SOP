You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

## 验证概况
- 完成批次 A~D：环境基线、文件安全、UI 刷新、短程稳定性、滚动冒烟、详情弹窗 PoC、参考图管理 PoC。
- 相关脚本/日志归档于 `docs/verification_logs/batchA~D/`，可作为后续回归基础。

## 核心结论
- Electron 能够覆盖 Qt 核心功能：主窗口、基本交互、详情弹窗、参考图管理均验证成功。
- `docs/electron_architecture_stage3.md` 给出主进程/渲染层/IPC/后端协同设计与风险列表。
- `docs/stage3_summary_20251010.md` 汇总阶段成果、缺口与阶段 4 建议。

## 关键缺口/风险
- 视频播放与导出、模型任务调度、Schema 表单、字体缩放/主题尚未实现，需要阶段 4 聚焦。
- 打包签名、自动更新、多平台验证待安排。

## 下一步建议
- 审批架构蓝图与阶段总结，确定阶段 4 迁移计划。
- 选定前端技术栈（建议 React+TS），建立任务管理、性能监控、打包流程。
- 将批次脚本纳入 CI 形成自动化验证矩阵。

- Seedream/Seedance 管线统一 envelope 已完结；QT 端、诊断脚本与 CLI 均改为读取 `code/data/errors/meta`，保留 `success/error` 兼容层。
- 新增命令行工具 `tools/seedream_cli.py`（T2I/I2I、多参考图、可选本地保存），实测任务 `aae6a5ba-f623-425e-95f1-d1e7e25cd6c6` 成功，主图已写入 `/Users/yunchang/Downloads/01-哥们/images/20251014/02176044013364387536ccb70d6c1a12319f6b583ee3463a27e0b_0.jpg`。
- Mock/E2E 覆盖：`tests/e2e/seedream_envelope_flow.py` 验证 envelope 字段一致性；`tests/e2e/seedance_reference_flow.py --mode real` 触发 Lite 1080p → 720p 回退（任务 `cgt-20251014190723-vzrbv`，`camera_fixed=False`）。
- 诊断工具 `tools/test_video_reference_fix.py`、`tools/diagnose_video_reference_storage.py` 现可解析 `data.reference_assets`、`storage.local`，结合 CLI 输出完成自检。
- 文档 `docs/planning/stage4_m4-2_api_unification_prep_20251014.md` 已增补晚间验证记录；后续仅需关注 Lite 模型分辨率策略与 CLI 扩展需求。

## 当前状态
- Seedream/Formily Schema 1.1/1.2 已上线，自定义尺寸、参数校验与 ReferencePicker 联动稳定。
- Seedance 后端支持 Lite I2V 多参考图（1–4 张），默认时长 5s；真实联调视频已下载于 `seedance_outputs/`
- 多参考图生成效果确认满意，后续视觉调整留给用户自主调参。

## 下一步建议
1. 编写端到端测试脚本：mock + 真机（可配置开关），验证参数映射及生成成功路径，纳入 CI 手动测试步骤。
2. 在文档中补充多参考图使用说明（提示词模板、参考图数量限制、模式选择逻辑），确保跨窗口协作一致。
3. 预留后续增强（如参考图权重、Pro 模式连通、提示词库）讨论条目；待产品确认后再排期。

- 已使用 `git archive` 生成 HEAD 备份：`backups/stage4_m2_backup_HEAD_20251014_1144.tar.gz`，以便回滚。
- 计划步骤：
  1. 定稿统一响应 Schema 与 Ark 错误映射。
  2. 回溯 Seedream 管线（client/manager + Electron PoC）。
  3. 回溯 Seedance 管线（多参考图/首尾帧），同步脚本与存储。
  4. 更新 Repository/CLI/自检工具链。
  5. 完成单测/集成/端到端 + CLI/Electron 回归。
- 每个阶段完成后会在 Serena 记录成果与测试结果，方便审批节点复查。

## 已完成
- Seedream/Formily Schema 升级到 1.1/1.2 版本，自定义尺寸、自定义参数与 ReferencePicker 交互落地。
- Seedance Client/Manager/Provider 支持：统一 5s 默认时长，多参考图 I2V 模式自动选型、maps content.role=reference_image。
- 与火山引擎真实联调：Lite I2V 多参考图（1–4 张）请求成功，生成视频已保存至 `seedance_outputs/`。

## 待确认 / 下一步
- 视觉团队评估多参考图输出质量，收集反馈，决定是否需要额外提示语或权重参数。
- 补充端到端测试脚本（mock+真机）记录 `reference_image` 行为，纳入回归。
- 若后端开放更多角色/参数（如参考图权重、角色标签），及时更新 Schema 与 Provider。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

## 已完成
- Seedream/Seedance 管线改为统一 envelope（`code/data/errors/meta`），并保持 success/error 兼容层；Qt、CLI、诊断脚本同步适配。
- Seedream CLI `_print_summary` 解析统一响应字段，输出任务状态、fallback 与本地存储摘要；诊断脚本可协同检查。
- Lite 多参考图 cameraFixed 限制统一回退逻辑：自动取消固定镜头、设置 `fallback.applied=True`，Ark 映射与提示同步。
- Mock/E2E/单元测试运行通过：`seedream_envelope_flow.py`、`seedance_reference_flow.py`、`pytest tests/unit/test_provider_schema.py`。
- 真机验证完成：`tests/e2e/seedance_reference_flow.py --mode real` 分别以 720p/1080p 触发 Lite 多参考图任务（`cgt-20251015112241-2xn5j`、`cgt-20251015112331-cmf74`），生成视频成功，fallback 正确标记 cameraFixed 关闭与 1080p→720p 回退，详见 `docs/verification_logs/seedance_lite_multi_reference_20251015.md`。
- 文档 `docs/planning/stage4_m4-2_api_unification_prep_20251014.md`、`docs/planning/stage4_m4-2_summary_20251016.md` 与 Serena 记忆同步更新，可直接作为审批材料。

## 遗留待办
1. Seedream CLI 后续补充常见错误指引/提示语，基于使用反馈优化（可与 M4-3 流程合并执行）。
2. 历史瀑布虚拟化与历史卡片字体统一仍待布局审批窗口，当前阶段仅记录需求。
3. 汇总阶段性审批材料（含测试日志、CLI 摘要、真机验证记录），提交后方可启动 M4-3。

## 下一阶段衔接建议（M4-3）
- 以 Formily Schema 1.2 为基线推进任务调度 + Schema 表单 PoC，明确状态管理、IPC 交互、双跑验证指标。
- 梳理调度核心接口（队列、回调、失败退避）并制定测试矩阵，纳入审批材料。
- 准备 Qt/Electron 双跑原型对照，采集性能与体验数据，形成阶段指标。
- 继续保持 Serena 记忆更新，关键节点形成决策卡/小结，确保审批上下文完整。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

## 目标
- 在 Electron 验证通过后，启动正式迁移工作，覆盖前端架构、后端 API、任务调度、视频链路、打包与监控体系。
- 保持 Qt 体系作为回滚方案；执行期间禁止修改现有 Qt 代码，除非用于比较或紧急修复。

## 主要任务
1. **前端架构落地**（React + TS + Zustand/Redux Toolkit）：建立基础工程、组件规范、核心模块原型。
2. **后端 API 归一化**：整理 Python 服务接口，统一请求/响应格式与错误码。
3. **任务调度与 Schema 表单选型**：比较 Formily/JSON Forms，设计 IPC 与任务管理策略。
4. **视频链路补全**：验证视频播放、缩略图、导出、日志链路在 Electron 下的实现。
5. **打包与多平台验证**：构建打包流程（含签名）、自动更新、安全策略、多平台冒烟测试。
6. **性能与监控体系**：搭建前端性能/错误监控，扩展 CI/CD 流程覆盖测试与发布。

## 里程碑
- M4-1：前端工程基础与组件规范完成。
- M4-2：后端 API 归一化方案与 PoC 通过。
- M4-3：任务调度与 Schema 表单选型确定并完成 PoC。
- M4-4：视频链路与打包流程 PoC 通过。
- M4-5：性能/错误监控与 CI/CD 流水线初版上线。

每个里程碑需：
- 写入 Serena 阶段总结。
- 提交设计/PoC 文档与风险清单。
- 明确回滚方案。

## 审批与依赖
- 阶段 3 总结与技术路线决策已获批准。
- 执行前需审批各项方案（前端栈、API 归一化、任务/表单、视频链路、打包、监控）。
- 资源：前端/后端执行窗口、证书与打包环境、CI/CD 权限。

## 注意事项
- 执行窗口需使用 Serena MCP 工具，遵循 `docs/window_startup_checklist.md`。
- 任何代码迁移前，先完成 PoC 与审批，确保可回滚。
- 若在执行中发现 Electron 无法满足特定能力，立即停止并汇报，等待决策。

## 已完成
- Seedream/Seedance 管线改为统一 envelope（`code/data/errors/meta`），并保持 success/error 兼容层；Qt、CLI、诊断脚本同步适配。
- Seedream CLI `_print_summary` 解析统一响应字段，输出任务状态、fallback 与本地存储摘要；诊断脚本可协同检查。
- Lite 多参考图 cameraFixed 限制统一回退逻辑：自动取消固定镜头、设置 `fallback.applied=True`，Ark 映射与提示同步。
- Mock/E2E/单元测试运行通过：`seedream_envelope_flow.py`、`seedance_reference_flow.py`、`pytest tests/unit/test_provider_schema.py`。
- 真机验证完成：`tests/e2e/seedance_reference_flow.py --mode real` 分别以 720p/1080p 触发 Lite 多参考图任务（`cgt-20251015112241-2xn5j`、`cgt-20251015112331-cmf74`），生成视频成功，fallback 正确标记 cameraFixed 关闭与 1080p→720p 回退，详见 `docs/verification_logs/seedance_lite_multi_reference_20251015.md`。
- 文档 `docs/planning/stage4_m4-2_api_unification_prep_20251014.md`、`docs/planning/stage4_m4-2_summary_20251016.md` 与 Serena 记忆同步更新，可直接作为审批材料。

## 遗留待办
1. Seedream CLI 后续补充常见错误指引/提示语，基于使用反馈优化（可与 M4-3 流程合并执行）。
2. 历史瀑布虚拟化与历史卡片字体统一仍待布局审批窗口，当前阶段仅记录需求。
3. 汇总阶段性审批材料（含测试日志、CLI 摘要、真机验证记录），提交后方可启动 M4-3。

## 下一阶段衔接建议（M4-3）
- 以 Formily Schema 1.2 为基线推进任务调度 + Schema 表单 PoC，明确状态管理、IPC 交互、双跑验证指标。
- 梳理调度核心接口（队列、回调、失败退避）并制定测试矩阵，纳入审批材料。
- 准备 Qt/Electron 双跑原型对照，采集性能与体验数据，形成阶段指标。
- 继续保持 Serena 记忆更新，关键节点形成决策卡/小结，确保审批上下文完整。

## 核心目标
- 在 Electron + React/TS 工程内落地 Formily Schema v1.2 与任务调度 Orchestrator，打通前端表单 → Python API → Ark envelope 全链路。
- 建立双跑原型与指标采集，确保 Qt ↔ Electron 任务结果对照可度量、可回滚。

## 主要交付
1. `seedream-client/src/constants/schema.ts` + `schema-version.ts`：抽取分辨率、参考图、参数范围等常量，并同步 Formily Schema。
2. `renderer/src/stores/taskOrchestrator.ts`（Zustand）+ `modules/tasks/orchestrator.py`（Python）：统一任务队列、状态更新、fallback 展示。
3. `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py` + `npm run dev:dual` 启动脚本：验证双跑流程、产出耗时/成功率指标。
4. 文档：`docs/planning/stage4_m4-3_execution_plan_20251017.md`、《Formily Schema v1.2 映射说明》、《任务调度设计》、双跑指标报告。

## 前置依赖
- 完成 Lite 多参考图 720p/1080p 真机回归并归档结果。
- 继续遵守 UI 布局锁定，Formily 改造仅限交互与常量调整。
- React/Vite 脚手架与 NPM 权限确认可用。

## 测试矩阵
- 单元：常量转换 & 状态 reducer（Vitest/Pytest）。
- 集成：Formily → Zustand → IPC → Python → envelope（`npm run test:formily`, `npm run test:orchestrator`）。
- E2E：`python tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py`、Seedream CLI/诊断脚本。
- 真机：Seedream/Seedance 典型任务与 Lite 多参考图链路。

## 审批说明
- 当前处于待审批状态，未经确认不得修改前端 Schema 或任务调度代码。
- 执行顺序建议：Schema 常量 → Orchestrator → 双跑验证 → 审批包与决策卡。
- 每个阶段完成后更新 Serena 记忆，记录关键指标与风险。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

## 1. 历史瀑布流
- **实现方案**：React + Ant Design Card + React Virtuoso（可动态高度）；数据取自 batchC 日志，保存为 mock JSON。
- **验证指标**：首屏渲染时间、滚动 FPS、内存利用；与阶段 3 数据对比。
- **对照方式**：Qt 版与 Electron 版并列截图、录像；记录滚动手感、卡片布局一致性。

## 2. 详情弹窗
- **实现方案**：Ant Design Modal + Tabs（基础信息/参考图/导出日志）；使用 Zustand 管理状态。
- **IPC Mock**：利用 `msw` 或自建 mock 层模拟 `detail:*` 返回，确保主进程协议可接入。
- **验证**：检查布局、按钮状态、文件导出调用流程；收集触发日志与错误提示一致性。

## 3. 参考图管理
- **实现方案**：Ant Design Upload.Dragger + List + Dropdown；结合 `sortablejs` 或 AntD Table 拖拽扩展。
- **文件操作**：仅触发预设 IPC 接口（主进程 mock），验证白名单路径校验与异常处理。
- **验证**：导入/删除/排序操作录像，确认提示文案、失败回滚符合需求。

## 4. 自动化与记录
- **视觉回归**：使用 Playwright `toHaveScreenshot` 或 Storybook Chromatic 对比关键页面；保存基准图。
- **操作脚本**：复用阶段 3 脚本（滚动冒烟、详情、参考图）并适配新接口；产出日志与截图。
- **指标日志**：创建 `docs/m4-1_metrics.md`（执行后写入），记录性能、交互测试结果。

## 5. 交付物
- 《双跑验证报告》：包含对照截图、性能指标、问题清单与改进建议。
- Serena 记忆：写入阶段总结与关键决策（如组件库定稿、虚拟列表表现）。
- 会议检查清单：与用户共同确认 UI 对齐、性能达标、安全约束未破坏。

## 目标
- 在 Electron 验证通过后，启动正式迁移工作，覆盖前端架构、后端 API、任务调度、视频链路、打包与监控体系。
- 保持 Qt 体系作为回滚方案；执行期间禁止修改现有 Qt 代码，除非用于比较或紧急修复。

## 主要任务
1. **前端架构落地**（React + TS + Zustand/Redux Toolkit）：建立基础工程、组件规范、核心模块原型。
2. **后端 API 归一化**：整理 Python 服务接口，统一请求/响应格式与错误码。
3. **任务调度与 Schema 表单选型**：比较 Formily/JSON Forms，设计 IPC 与任务管理策略。
4. **视频链路补全**：验证视频播放、缩略图、导出、日志链路在 Electron 下的实现。
5. **打包与多平台验证**：构建打包流程（含签名）、自动更新、安全策略、多平台冒烟测试。
6. **性能与监控体系**：搭建前端性能/错误监控，扩展 CI/CD 流程覆盖测试与发布。

## 里程碑
- M4-1：前端工程基础与组件规范完成。
- M4-2：后端 API 归一化方案与 PoC 通过。
- M4-3：任务调度与 Schema 表单选型确定并完成 PoC。
- M4-4：视频链路与打包流程 PoC 通过。
- M4-5：性能/错误监控与 CI/CD 流水线初版上线。

每个里程碑需：
- 写入 Serena 阶段总结。
- 提交设计/PoC 文档与风险清单。
- 明确回滚方案。

## 审批与依赖
- 阶段 3 总结与技术路线决策已获批准。
- 执行前需审批各项方案（前端栈、API 归一化、任务/表单、视频链路、打包、监控）。
- 资源：前端/后端执行窗口、证书与打包环境、CI/CD 权限。

## 注意事项
- 执行窗口需使用 Serena MCP 工具，遵循 `docs/window_startup_checklist.md`。
- 任何代码迁移前，先完成 PoC 与审批，确保可回滚。
- 若在执行中发现 Electron 无法满足特定能力，立即停止并汇报，等待决策。

## 核心目标
- 在 Electron + React/TS 工程内落地 Formily Schema v1.2 与任务调度 Orchestrator，打通前端表单 → Python API → Ark envelope 全链路。
- 建立双跑原型与指标采集，确保 Qt ↔ Electron 任务结果对照可度量、可回滚。

## 主要交付
1. `seedream-client/src/constants/schema.ts` + `schema-version.ts`：抽取分辨率、参考图、参数范围等常量，并同步 Formily Schema。
2. `renderer/src/stores/taskOrchestrator.ts`（Zustand）+ `modules/tasks/orchestrator.py`（Python）：统一任务队列、状态更新、fallback 展示。
3. `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py` + `npm run dev:dual` 启动脚本：验证双跑流程、产出耗时/成功率指标。
4. 文档：`docs/planning/stage4_m4-3_execution_plan_20251017.md`、《Formily Schema v1.2 映射说明》、《任务调度设计》、双跑指标报告。

## 前置依赖
- 完成 Lite 多参考图 720p/1080p 真机回归并归档结果。
- 继续遵守 UI 布局锁定，Formily 改造仅限交互与常量调整。
- React/Vite 脚手架与 NPM 权限确认可用。

## 测试矩阵
- 单元：常量转换 & 状态 reducer（Vitest/Pytest）。
- 集成：Formily → Zustand → IPC → Python → envelope（`npm run test:formily`, `npm run test:orchestrator`）。
- E2E：`python tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py`、Seedream CLI/诊断脚本。
- 真机：Seedream/Seedance 典型任务与 Lite 多参考图链路。

## 审批说明
- 当前处于待审批状态，未经确认不得修改前端 Schema 或任务调度代码。
- 执行顺序建议：Schema 常量 → Orchestrator → 双跑验证 → 审批包与决策卡。
- 每个阶段完成后更新 Serena 记忆，记录关键指标与风险。

### 参考图画廊闪退
- **错误类型**：ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
- **错误位置**：qt_app.py 行 1548
- **调用栈**：
  ```
  _on_reference_clicked -> open_reference_preview -> load_asset -> 
  viewer.setPixmap(QPixmap()) -> reset_zoom() -> update_display()
  ```
- **根本原因**：计算缩放比例时 original_pixmap 宽度为 0
- **代码片段**：
  ```python
  base_scale_x = container_size.width() / self.original_pixmap.width()
  ```

## 需要修复的问题列表

### 1. UI 相关问题
- [ ] 参考图画廊点击闪退（ZeroDivisionError）
- [ ] 空 QPixmap 导致的除零错误
- [ ] 图片查看器缩放逻辑需要增加边界检查

### 2. 代码质量问题

```python
def setPixmap(self, pixmap):
    if pixmap.isNull() or pixmap.width() == 0 or pixmap.height() == 0:
        # 处理空图片情况
        self.original_pixmap = QPixmap(1, 1)  # 创建 1x1 占位图
        self.original_pixmap.fill(Qt.transparent)
    else:
        self.original_pixmap = pixmap
    self.reset_zoom()
```

### 中期改进
1. 将 qt_app.py 按功能模块拆分

## 交付内容
- 新增 `modules/tasks/bridge_process.py` 与 Electron 主进程 `tasks` IPC 模块，实现 Electron ↔ Python `TaskOrchestrator` 的长连接通信，支持 `tasks:submit` / `tasks:abort` / `tasks:summary`。
- React 渲染层通过 `useTaskBridge` 订阅任务摘要，`buildTaskPayload` 将 Formily 输出、参考图与默认值转换为统一 envelope 参数结构；`App.tsx` 接入任务面板实时展示状态。
- 追加 `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py` 及 `npm run dev:dual`（Electron + mock 指标脚本）作为双跑验证雏形。

## 测试
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test -- --run`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_envelope_parser.py tests/unit/test_task_orchestrator.py`

## 后续关注
- CLI 常见错误指引尚未补强（M4-2 遗留）。
- 双跑脚本仍为 mock，需要接入真实 IPC → Qt 收敛链路并产出指标报告。
- 布局锁定仍有效，前端 UI 仅新增逻辑与监控面板，无结构改动。

- 编写《阶段 4 - M4-3 Step C/D 测试与指标汇总（2025-10-18）》记录已跑命令、mock 指标样例、后续测试计划。
- 编写《阶段 4 - M4-3 Step D 审批提要（2025-10-18 草稿）》汇总代码亮点、验证情况、回滚策略、待办事项和审批材料清单。

## 测试
- `npm --prefix seedream-client run lint`
- `npm --prefix seedream-client run test -- --run`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_envelope_parser.py tests/unit/test_task_orchestrator.py`
- `python tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py`

## 待续工作
- CLI 常见错误指引仍待补强（M4-2 遗留）。
- 双跑指标需接入真实 Electron ↔ Qt 任务，当前仅为 mock 样例。
- Step D 完成后需准备 Serena 决策卡与审批包提交。

## 实测范围
- 执行 `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_real.py`，分别覆盖 `image-3.0`、`image-4.0`、`video-lite`（dual 模式）与 `video-pro`。
- 每个任务同时走 TaskOrchestrator（Electron 链路）与直接调用管理器（Qt 链路），生成独立 envelope 摘要与耗时对比。
- 报告存档于 `docs/verification_logs/dual_run/dual_run_{model}_20251018.json`，`diff` 字段仅记录主输出文件/链接 ID 差异（属预期）。

## 关键观察
- 所有任务均返回 `SUCCESS`，fallback 行为与 Lite cameraFixed 自动关闭、一致的 720p 回退保持一致。
- Electron 与 Qt 耗时均在可接受范围：图片 3~12s、视频约 50~70s；Electron 端略快/略慢取决于排队时间。
- 视频任务生成本地文件时出现缩略图生成告警（现有实现已知问题），不影响视频保存。

## 后续建议
- 如需扩展更多场景（图生图、多参考图、超长时长），可复用脚本追加运行并更新报告。
- 审批材料应引用上述 JSON 与 CLI 摘要作为性能/一致性证明。

## 已完成
- Seedream/Seedance 管线改为统一 envelope（`code/data/errors/meta`），并保持 success/error 兼容层；Qt、CLI、诊断脚本同步适配。
- Seedream CLI `_print_summary` 解析统一响应字段，输出任务状态、fallback 与本地存储摘要；诊断脚本可协同检查。
- Lite 多参考图 cameraFixed 限制统一回退逻辑：自动取消固定镜头、设置 `fallback.applied=True`，Ark 映射与提示同步。
- Mock/E2E/单元测试运行通过：`seedream_envelope_flow.py`、`seedance_reference_flow.py`、`pytest tests/unit/test_provider_schema.py`。
- 真机验证完成：`tests/e2e/seedance_reference_flow.py --mode real` 分别以 720p/1080p 触发 Lite 多参考图任务（`cgt-20251015112241-2xn5j`、`cgt-20251015112331-cmf74`），生成视频成功，fallback 正确标记 cameraFixed 关闭与 1080p→720p 回退，详见 `docs/verification_logs/seedance_lite_multi_reference_20251015.md`。
- 文档 `docs/planning/stage4_m4-2_api_unification_prep_20251014.md`、`docs/planning/stage4_m4-2_summary_20251016.md` 与 Serena 记忆同步更新，可直接作为审批材料。

## 遗留待办
1. Seedream CLI 后续补充常见错误指引/提示语，基于使用反馈优化（可与 M4-3 流程合并执行）。
2. 历史瀑布虚拟化与历史卡片字体统一仍待布局审批窗口，当前阶段仅记录需求。
3. 汇总阶段性审批材料（含测试日志、CLI 摘要、真机验证记录），提交后方可启动 M4-3。

## 下一阶段衔接建议（M4-3）
- 以 Formily Schema 1.2 为基线推进任务调度 + Schema 表单 PoC，明确状态管理、IPC 交互、双跑验证指标。
- 梳理调度核心接口（队列、回调、失败退避）并制定测试矩阵，纳入审批材料。
- 准备 Qt/Electron 双跑原型对照，采集性能与体验数据，形成阶段指标。
- 继续保持 Serena 记忆更新，关键节点形成决策卡/小结，确保审批上下文完整。

## 已完成
- Formily Schema 常量抽取：`seedream-client/src/constants/schema.ts`、`schema-version.ts` 支持版本递增（v1.2），并在 `docs/planning/formily_schema_v1.2_mapping_20251017.md` 记录映射。
- 状态管理基线：新增 `src/store/model.store.ts`，`App.tsx` 自动加载 Schema / 同步参考图，Segmented 选项使用 `MODEL_SEGMENT_OPTIONS`。
- 任务调度链路：建立 `src/store/taskOrchestrator.ts`（Zustand + Immer）与 Python `modules/tasks/orchestrator.py`、`modules/api/envelope_parser.py`，Vitest/Pytest 单测通过，CLI 共用 envelope 解析。
- 依赖更新：`seedream-client/package.json` 引入 `immer@10.0.3` 支撑 Zustand 中间件。
- 测试：`npm run lint`、`npm run test -- --run`、`pytest tests/unit/test_envelope_parser.py tests/unit/test_task_orchestrator.py` 均通过。

## 待办（审批后执行）
1. 双跑验证链路：串联 IPC → Electron → Python，新增 `npm run dev:dual` 与 `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py`，采集指标并形成报告。
2. CLI 体验补强：在 `tools/seedream_cli.py` 增加常见错误提示/回退说明。
3. 审批输出：整理 Stage M4-3 Step C/D 执行计划、测试矩阵、双跑指标，完成审批包与 Serena 决策卡。

## 约束提醒
- 严格遵守布局锁定：仅调整逻辑与常量，不改动现有 UI 布局。
- Qt 方案保留为回滚渠道；双跑对照需记录差异与回滚路径。
- 所有执行前依旧需审批确认。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

## 🚨 核心工作原则 (永远遵循)

1. **与Serena MCP同步上下文记忆**
   - 任何时候都要确保跟serena mcp保持同步上下文记忆
   - 及时使用write_memory更新项目状态和进展
   - 避免上下文断裂导致信息丢失

2. **严格控制上下文长度**
   - 及时清理上下文长度
   - 分段执行分段读代码，全盘理解
   - 禁止直接把主程序代码上传塞爆上下文
   - 严格控制上下文长度，防止塞爆大模型token

3. **分段执行策略**
   - 使用find_symbol等工具精确定位需要的代码片段
   - 避免使用read_file读取大文件
   - 优先使用search_for_pattern进行目标搜索
   - 一次只处理必要的代码段

4. **上下文管理方案**
   - 使用get_symbols_overview了解文件结构
   - 使用find_symbol精确读取需要的方法/类
   - 重要状态及时写入memory
   - 长对话中定期同步状态到serena

## 实施要求
- 这是最高优先级指令，任何时候都要遵循
- 方案自己选择，但必须严格控制token使用
- 确保与serena mcp的上下文同步不断裂

## 核心目标
- 在 Electron + React/TS 工程内落地 Formily Schema v1.2 与任务调度 Orchestrator，打通前端表单 → Python API → Ark envelope 全链路。
- 建立双跑原型与指标采集，确保 Qt ↔ Electron 任务结果对照可度量、可回滚。

## 主要交付
1. `seedream-client/src/constants/schema.ts` + `schema-version.ts`：抽取分辨率、参考图、参数范围等常量，并同步 Formily Schema。
2. `renderer/src/stores/taskOrchestrator.ts`（Zustand）+ `modules/tasks/orchestrator.py`（Python）：统一任务队列、状态更新、fallback 展示。
3. `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py` + `npm run dev:dual` 启动脚本：验证双跑流程、产出耗时/成功率指标。
4. 文档：`docs/planning/stage4_m4-3_execution_plan_20251017.md`、《Formily Schema v1.2 映射说明》、《任务调度设计》、双跑指标报告。

## 前置依赖
- 完成 Lite 多参考图 720p/1080p 真机回归并归档结果。
- 继续遵守 UI 布局锁定，Formily 改造仅限交互与常量调整。
- React/Vite 脚手架与 NPM 权限确认可用。

## 测试矩阵
- 单元：常量转换 & 状态 reducer（Vitest/Pytest）。
- 集成：Formily → Zustand → IPC → Python → envelope（`npm run test:formily`, `npm run test:orchestrator`）。
- E2E：`python tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py`、Seedream CLI/诊断脚本。
- 真机：Seedream/Seedance 典型任务与 Lite 多参考图链路。

## 审批说明
- 当前处于待审批状态，未经确认不得修改前端 Schema 或任务调度代码。
- 执行顺序建议：Schema 常量 → Orchestrator → 双跑验证 → 审批包与决策卡。
- 每个阶段完成后更新 Serena 记忆，记录关键指标与风险。

## 已完成
- Formily Schema 常量抽取：`seedream-client/src/constants/schema.ts`、`schema-version.ts` 支持版本递增（v1.2），并在 `docs/planning/formily_schema_v1.2_mapping_20251017.md` 记录映射。
- 状态管理基线：新增 `src/store/model.store.ts`，`App.tsx` 自动加载 Schema / 同步参考图，Segmented 选项使用 `MODEL_SEGMENT_OPTIONS`。
- 任务调度链路：建立 `src/store/taskOrchestrator.ts`（Zustand + Immer）与 Python `modules/tasks/orchestrator.py`、`modules/api/envelope_parser.py`，Vitest/Pytest 单测通过，CLI 共用 envelope 解析。
- 依赖更新：`seedream-client/package.json` 引入 `immer@10.0.3` 支撑 Zustand 中间件。
- 测试：`npm run lint`、`npm run test -- --run`、`pytest tests/unit/test_envelope_parser.py tests/unit/test_task_orchestrator.py` 均通过。

## 待办（审批后执行）
1. 双跑验证链路：串联 IPC → Electron → Python，新增 `npm run dev:dual` 与 `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py`，采集指标并形成报告。
2. CLI 体验补强：在 `tools/seedream_cli.py` 增加常见错误提示/回退说明。
3. 审批输出：整理 Stage M4-3 Step C/D 执行计划、测试矩阵、双跑指标，完成审批包与 Serena 决策卡。

## 约束提醒
- 严格遵守布局锁定：仅调整逻辑与常量，不改动现有 UI 布局。
- Qt 方案保留为回滚渠道；双跑对照需记录差异与回滚路径。
- 所有执行前依旧需审批确认。

## 交付内容
- 新增 `modules/tasks/bridge_process.py` 与 Electron 主进程 `tasks` IPC 模块，实现 Electron ↔ Python `TaskOrchestrator` 的长连接通信，支持 `tasks:submit` / `tasks:abort` / `tasks:summary`。
- React 渲染层通过 `useTaskBridge` 订阅任务摘要，`buildTaskPayload` 将 Formily 输出、参考图与默认值转换为统一 envelope 参数结构；`App.tsx` 接入任务面板实时展示状态。
- 追加 `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py` 及 `npm run dev:dual`（Electron + mock 指标脚本）作为双跑验证雏形。

## 测试
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test -- --run`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_envelope_parser.py tests/unit/test_task_orchestrator.py`

## 后续关注
- CLI 常见错误指引尚未补强（M4-2 遗留）。
- 双跑脚本仍为 mock，需要接入真实 IPC → Qt 收敛链路并产出指标报告。
- 布局锁定仍有效，前端 UI 仅新增逻辑与监控面板，无结构改动。

## 实测范围
- 执行 `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_real.py`，分别覆盖 `image-3.0`、`image-4.0`、`video-lite`（dual 模式）与 `video-pro`。
- 每个任务同时走 TaskOrchestrator（Electron 链路）与直接调用管理器（Qt 链路），生成独立 envelope 摘要与耗时对比。
- 报告存档于 `docs/verification_logs/dual_run/dual_run_{model}_20251018.json`，`diff` 字段仅记录主输出文件/链接 ID 差异（属预期）。

## 关键观察
- 所有任务均返回 `SUCCESS`，fallback 行为与 Lite cameraFixed 自动关闭、一致的 720p 回退保持一致。
- Electron 与 Qt 耗时均在可接受范围：图片 3~12s、视频约 50~70s；Electron 端略快/略慢取决于排队时间。
- 视频任务生成本地文件时出现缩略图生成告警（现有实现已知问题），不影响视频保存。

## 后续建议
- 如需扩展更多场景（图生图、多参考图、超长时长），可复用脚本追加运行并更新报告。
- 审批材料应引用上述 JSON 与 CLI 摘要作为性能/一致性证明。

- 已完成 SeedreamManager 接入，SeedanceManager 将复用统一接口。
- [`SeedanceManager` 现状] `generate_video` -> `_save_video_locally` 仍使用 requests 下载并保存到自定义目录，字段 `local_path`/`thumbnail_local_path` 需保持兼容。
- [`UnifiedStorageManagerV2` 能力] `save_content_file('videos', ...)`、`save_reference_asset` 已支持返回 `absolute_path`/`local_path` 供直接使用。
- 下一步改造要点：
  1. `_save_video_locally` 使用 `save_content_file` 保存视频数据，生成缩略图后调用 `save_reference_asset` 或统一写入 `thumbnail_path`。
  2. 统一返回结构保留 `file_path`/`local_path` 字段，兼容 UI 与导出逻辑。
  3. 处理 API 缩略图 fallback：统一保存到 `images` 类型下，确保路径字段一致。
- 风险点：
  - 视频文件体积大，注意下载/写入过程中临时文件清理。
  - 缩略图生成失败逻辑需保持与 UI 现有逻辑兼容。

## 交付内容
- 新增 `modules/tasks/bridge_process.py` 与 Electron 主进程 `tasks` IPC 模块，实现 Electron ↔ Python `TaskOrchestrator` 的长连接通信，支持 `tasks:submit` / `tasks:abort` / `tasks:summary`。
- React 渲染层通过 `useTaskBridge` 订阅任务摘要，`buildTaskPayload` 将 Formily 输出、参考图与默认值转换为统一 envelope 参数结构；`App.tsx` 接入任务面板实时展示状态。
- 追加 `tests/e2e/task_dual_run_mock.py` 及 `npm run dev:dual`（Electron + mock 指标脚本）作为双跑验证雏形。

## 测试
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test -- --run`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_envelope_parser.py tests/unit/test_task_orchestrator.py`

## 后续关注
- CLI 常见错误指引尚未补强（M4-2 遗留）。
- 双跑脚本仍为 mock，需要接入真实 IPC → Qt 收敛链路并产出指标报告。
- 布局锁定仍有效，前端 UI 仅新增逻辑与监控面板，无结构改动。

- 调整 `components/models/history_model_optimized.py`：新增 `PixmapRole`/`ThumbnailPathRole`，让旧委托通过 `ImageHistoryModel.PixmapRole` 能获取到 QPixmap。
- `OptimizedHistoryModel.data` 现统一调用 `_resolve_thumbnail_path` 并交给 `ThumbnailCache` 返回 QPixmap。
- `ThumbnailCache.get` 补充空路径和 Path 类型兼容，避免传入非字符串导致崩溃。
- 新增 `_resolve_thumbnail_path`，按旧逻辑优先级选择 `thumbnail_local_path` 等字段，保留字符串路径访问（`ThumbnailPathRole`）。
- 通过脚本验证 `PixmapRole` 返回 `QPixmap`，建议在 GUI 中再做一次手动回归。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

## 状态概览
- M4-3 全部交付完成：Formily 常量、任务调度 Orchestrator、CLI 提示增强、真实双跑指标与审批包均已归档。
- M4-4 准备完成：安全基线合入 (`nodeIntegration:false`、`contextIsolation:true`、`sandbox:true`)，preload 无 Node 依赖；缩略图策略约束落档；UI 一页纸护栏生效。

## 快检记录
- 缩略图冒烟：`VideoThumbnailGenerator` 仍能生成缩略图（日志输出 `thumb_generate` 摘要），确认安全改动不阻碍链路。
- Serena 记忆：`阶段执行_阶段4_M4-3收尾_20251018`、`阶段执行_阶段4_M4-4_开工前规划_20251018`、`设计系统_最小UI协作规范_20251018` 均同步。

## 下一步
- 按计划启动 M4-4 Step A（播放器设计与实现），后续执行依赖该检查点状态。

## P0 行动
- **安全基线**：在 `electron/main/index.ts` 设置 `nodeIntegration:false`、`contextIsolation:true`、`sandbox:true`；如 preload 仍依赖 Node API，将逻辑迁移到主进程并通过 contextBridge 暴露白名单接口。
- **缩略图约束**：落地文档明确触发点（`save_content_file` 之后）、产物目录（`<storage>/thumbnails/videos/`）、配置键（`GEMENG_FFMPEG_ENABLED` 等）、日志字段（`thumb.strategy/took_ms/path/error`），保留 OpenCV 首帧回退。

## P1 行动
- **UI 护栏**：继续用 ConfigProvider token 注入主题；PR 模板新增“禁止硬编码样式 / 基本 A11y 自查”。`styles/antd-components.css` 暂保留过渡。
- **冒烟验证**：完成安全基线与约束后，执行一次 IPC→缩略图链路冒烟，确认日志字段与功能可用。

## 启动条件
- P0 项和冒烟测试通过后，即可启动 M4-4 Step A（播放器实现等后续工作）。

## 目标
- 补齐 Electron 视频链路：播放器、缩略图、导出、日志与打包流程。
- 在本阶段实施缩略图策略（ffmpeg 优先 + 首帧回退），并验证依赖与性能。
- 完成 Electron 打包 PoC（mac 主、win 选），形成安全/回滚说明。

## 关键步骤
1. 设计并审批视频播放组件与主/渲染进程协作方案。
2. 在 `modules/seedance/manager.py` 落地缩略图生成逻辑，覆盖 ffmpeg 成功/失败回退，补充单/集成测试。
3. 对齐导出与存储策略，提供用户操作指引与日志。
4. 执行 Electron 打包 PoC，输出构建脚本、产物与报告。
5. 跑通测试矩阵（播放器操作、缩略图生成、双跑回归、打包冒烟），整理审批材料。

## 注意事项
- 布局锁定仍生效，前端改动限于逻辑与状态。
- ffmpeg 依赖需可检测并给出回退提示，必要时随包携带或引导安装。
- Qt 链路保留作为回滚通道；所有关键节点需更新 Serena 记忆与审批材料。

## 目标
- 在 Electron 验证通过后，启动正式迁移工作，覆盖前端架构、后端 API、任务调度、视频链路、打包与监控体系。
- 保持 Qt 体系作为回滚方案；执行期间禁止修改现有 Qt 代码，除非用于比较或紧急修复。

## 主要任务
1. **前端架构落地**（React + TS + Zustand/Redux Toolkit）：建立基础工程、组件规范、核心模块原型。
2. **后端 API 归一化**：整理 Python 服务接口，统一请求/响应格式与错误码。
3. **任务调度与 Schema 表单选型**：比较 Formily/JSON Forms，设计 IPC 与任务管理策略。
4. **视频链路补全**：验证视频播放、缩略图、导出、日志链路在 Electron 下的实现。
5. **打包与多平台验证**：构建打包流程（含签名）、自动更新、安全策略、多平台冒烟测试。
6. **性能与监控体系**：搭建前端性能/错误监控，扩展 CI/CD 流程覆盖测试与发布。

## 里程碑
- M4-1：前端工程基础与组件规范完成。
- M4-2：后端 API 归一化方案与 PoC 通过。
- M4-3：任务调度与 Schema 表单选型确定并完成 PoC。
- M4-4：视频链路与打包流程 PoC 通过。
- M4-5：性能/错误监控与 CI/CD 流水线初版上线。

每个里程碑需：
- 写入 Serena 阶段总结。
- 提交设计/PoC 文档与风险清单。
- 明确回滚方案。

## 审批与依赖
- 阶段 3 总结与技术路线决策已获批准。
- 执行前需审批各项方案（前端栈、API 归一化、任务/表单、视频链路、打包、监控）。
- 资源：前端/后端执行窗口、证书与打包环境、CI/CD 权限。

## 注意事项
- 执行窗口需使用 Serena MCP 工具，遵循 `docs/window_startup_checklist.md`。
- 任何代码迁移前，先完成 PoC 与审批，确保可回滚。
- 若在执行中发现 Electron 无法满足特定能力，立即停止并汇报，等待决策。

## 成果
- 完成 Formily Schema v1.2 常量化、Zustand 状态基线、Python TaskOrchestrator 与 Electron IPC 桥接，CLI 中文提示增强同步上线。
- 双跑链路（mock + 真实）执行成功，`docs/verification_logs/dual_run/dual_run_{model}_20251018.json` 归档，CLI/Seedream/Seedance 全链路测试通过。
- 审批包组装完成，包含《Step D 审批提要》《执行计划》《测试与指标汇总》《缩略图策略说明》；用户已批准进入下一阶段。

## 风险/提醒
- 缩略图策略需在 `modules/seedance/manager.py` 实施“ffmpeg 优先 + 首帧回退”，执行前确认依赖与性能；实现后补测两条路径并更新文档。
- 布局锁定依旧有效，后续阶段禁止未经批准的 UI 结构改动。

## 下一步
- 根据审批意见，在下一阶段执行缩略图策略实现与验证。
- 筹备 Stage 4 - M4-4（视频链路/打包）规划，整理播放器、导出、打包相关需求与审批要点。

## 🚨 核心工作原则 (永远遵循)

1. **与Serena MCP同步上下文记忆**
   - 任何时候都要确保跟serena mcp保持同步上下文记忆
   - 及时使用write_memory更新项目状态和进展
   - 避免上下文断裂导致信息丢失

2. **严格控制上下文长度**
   - 及时清理上下文长度
   - 分段执行分段读代码，全盘理解
   - 禁止直接把主程序代码上传塞爆上下文
   - 严格控制上下文长度，防止塞爆大模型token

3. **分段执行策略**
   - 使用find_symbol等工具精确定位需要的代码片段
   - 避免使用read_file读取大文件
   - 优先使用search_for_pattern进行目标搜索
   - 一次只处理必要的代码段

4. **上下文管理方案**
   - 使用get_symbols_overview了解文件结构
   - 使用find_symbol精确读取需要的方法/类
   - 重要状态及时写入memory
   - 长对话中定期同步状态到serena

## 实施要求
- 这是最高优先级指令，任何时候都要遵循
- 方案自己选择，但必须严格控制token使用
- 确保与serena mcp的上下文同步不断裂

## 目标与范围
- 不扩大 M4 范围（播放器/缩略图/导出/打包），先建立最小护栏，降低 UI 返工。
- 非目标：完整视觉系统、全量 A11y 手册、大规模组件封装。

## 核心约定
1. **组件使用**：直接采用 Ant Design 官方组件（Button/Input/Form/Modal/Drawer/Table/Tabs 等），禁止业务层建立别名或覆写内部样式。
2. **主题与 Tokens**：
   - 唯一注入方式：应用根部的 `ConfigProvider.theme.token`；禁止页面/组件硬编码颜色、圆角、阴影、字号。
   - 建议启用 `cssVar` 模式，便于后续换肤；可在 `/tokens/tokens.json` 维护真源。
3. **A11y 红线**：
   - 键盘可达：Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Esc；Modal 支持 Esc；遵循 WAI-ARIA 键盘范式。
   - 文本对比度：正文≥4.5:1、大字≥3:1；颜色统一由 Token 提供。
4. **验收方式**：
   - Storybook 或等价工具覆盖 Button/Input/Form/Modal/Drawer/Table 基础状态。
   - PR 禁止新增硬编码样式常量；检查依赖 ConfigProvider Token。
5. **准入门槛**：
   - 应用根已通过 `<AppTheme>` 注入主题；业务代码无新增散落样式。
   - 关键页面键盘可操作，Modal Esc 关闭可行，聚焦态可见；抽检页面对比度达标。
   - Storybook 覆盖六类组件基础状态（可选但推荐）。
6. **执行提示**：
   - 在 `/app/renderer/src/AppTheme.tsx` 包裹 `<AppTheme>`；必要时建立 `/tokens/tokens.json`。
   - 抽取色值/尺寸至 token，迁移散落样式；初始化 Storybook 最小集。
   - PR 模板加入键盘可达/焦点可见/对比度自查项。

## 参考文档
- Ant Design 主题 & Token、自定义主题、CSS Variables、组件总览。
- WAI-ARIA Keyboard Interface、WCAG 2.1 对比度要求。
- Section 508 / EN 301 549 采购合规简介。

- Electron 增加导出面板（目录选择、结果提示）。
- Orchestrator/CLI 输出导出摘要；更新 API 文档。

## Step D · Electron 打包 PoC
- 选择 `electron-builder`，新增 `npm run build:mac`（可选 `build:win`）。
- 配置资源拷贝（ffmpeg 等）、codesign 占位符；执行打包并记录产物。
- 撰写《Electron 打包 PoC 报告》（依赖、步骤、风险、回滚）。

## Step E · 测试与审批
- 测试矩阵：播放器冒烟、缩略图单/集成测试、双跑回归、打包产物冒烟。
- 更新执行计划、编写《视频链路与打包设计说明》，整理审批包。
- 完成后写阶段执行记录/总结，记录指标与风险。

【记忆策略】
- 必须写 Serena（长期复用/避免踩坑）：接口/参数/协议变化；存储/数据结构变更；性能/并发取舍；Bug 根因与防回归；跨文件改动；架构/约定更新；里程碑决定。→ 写“决策卡”（含关联 commit/PR）。
- 只写摘要：纯局部、机械性微改（样式/注释/小测试/小修小补）。→ 1–3 句 + commit 哈希。
- 不写：密钥/隐私/大段源码（仅留链接与要点）。

【会话同步】
- 每次会话开头：读取本项目最近“决策卡/阶段小结”，用 ≤5 行复述再 /plan。
- 每个里程碑/合并/回滚后：write_memory 写“阶段小结/决策卡”。
- 跨会话继续任务：先生成“接力卡（≤8 行）”，作为后续提示。

## 状态概览
- M4-3 全部交付完成：Formily 常量、任务调度 Orchestrator、CLI 提示增强、真实双跑指标与审批包均已归档。
- M4-4 准备完成：安全基线合入 (`nodeIntegration:false`、`contextIsolation:true`、`sandbox:true`)，preload 无 Node 依赖；缩略图策略约束落档；UI 一页纸护栏生效。

## 快检记录
- 缩略图冒烟：`VideoThumbnailGenerator` 仍能生成缩略图（日志输出 `thumb_generate` 摘要），确认安全改动不阻碍链路。
- Serena 记忆：`阶段执行_阶段4_M4-3收尾_20251018`、`阶段执行_阶段4_M4-4_开工前规划_20251018`、`设计系统_最小UI协作规范_20251018` 均同步。

## 下一步
- 按计划启动 M4-4 Step A（播放器设计与实现），后续执行依赖该检查点状态。

## Step A · 视频播放/预览
- 发布《视频播放组件设计说明》，确保仅增逻辑不改栅格。
- 主进程新增 media IPC（open/preview），处理文件协议与权限。
- 渲染层实现 `<VideoPlayer>` 组件，接入任务结果面板，支持本地/远程播放、加载态、错误提示。
- 错误场景提供“打开所在位置”与外部播放器兜底。

## Step B · 缩略图策略
- `modules/seedance/manager.py` 增加 `generate_thumbnail(video_path)`：优先 ffmpeg，失败回退首帧（moviepy/Pillow）。
- 配置 `GEMENG_FFMPEG_ENABLED`；日志记录策略（ffmpeg/首帧）。
- 新增单测 `tests/unit/test_video_thumbnail.py` 和集成测 `tests/integration/test_seedance_thumbnail.py`。
- 更新缩略图策略文档、CLI 提示。

## Step C · 导出与存储
- 统一 CLI/Electron/Qt 导出路径与元数据；复核 `save_content_file`/`save_reference_asset`。
- Electron 增加导出面板（目录选择、结果提示）。
- Orchestrator/CLI 输出导出摘要；更新 API 文档。

## Step D · Electron 打包 PoC
- 选择 `electron-builder`，新增 `npm run build:mac`（可选 `build:win`）。
- 配置资源拷贝（ffmpeg 等）、codesign 占位符；执行打包并记录产物。
- 撰写《Electron 打包 PoC 报告》（依赖、步骤、风险、回滚）。

## Step E · 测试与审批
- 测试矩阵：播放器冒烟、缩略图单/集成测试、双跑回归、打包产物冒烟。
- 更新执行计划、编写《视频链路与打包设计说明》，整理审批包。
- 完成后写阶段执行记录/总结，记录指标与风险。

- 设计文档：新建 `docs/planning/stage4_m4-4_stepa_video_player_design_20251018.md`，明确主进程 IPC、渲染层组件与安全约束。
- 主进程：新增 `electron/main/ipc/modules/media.ts`（preview/open/reveal）并在 `ipc/index.ts` 注册；扩展 `shared/ipc-types.ts` / `preload/index.ts` / `vite-env.d.ts` 保证 Bridge API 完整。
- 渲染层：实现 `hooks/useMediaPreview.ts` 与 `components/player/video-player.tsx`，在 `App.tsx` 任务面板按模型类型嵌入播放器；保留布局锁定。
- 验证：`npm run lint`（在 `seedream-client` 下）通过；尚未执行真实视频冒烟，待 Step A 收口或 Step B 联动时补录。
- 后续提醒：Step B 缩略图策略落地前需复用 `media:preview` 的路径校验；完成播放链路后准备补充审批材料与冒烟记录，再衔接缩略图实现。

## P0 行动
- **安全基线**：在 `electron/main/index.ts` 设置 `nodeIntegration:false`、`contextIsolation:true`、`sandbox:true`；如 preload 仍依赖 Node API，将逻辑迁移到主进程并通过 contextBridge 暴露白名单接口。
- **缩略图约束**：落地文档明确触发点（`save_content_file` 之后）、产物目录（`<storage>/thumbnails/videos/`）、配置键（`GEMENG_FFMPEG_ENABLED` 等）、日志字段（`thumb.strategy/took_ms/path/error`），保留 OpenCV 首帧回退。

## P1 行动
- **UI 护栏**：继续用 ConfigProvider token 注入主题；PR 模板新增“禁止硬编码样式 / 基本 A11y 自查”。`styles/antd-components.css` 暂保留过渡。
- **冒烟验证**：完成安全基线与约束后，执行一次 IPC→缩略图链路冒烟，确认日志字段与功能可用。

## 启动条件
- P0 项和冒烟测试通过后，即可启动 M4-4 Step A（播放器实现等后续工作）。

## 目标
- 补齐 Electron 视频链路：播放器、缩略图、导出、日志与打包流程。
- 在本阶段实施缩略图策略（ffmpeg 优先 + 首帧回退），并验证依赖与性能。
- 完成 Electron 打包 PoC（mac 主、win 选），形成安全/回滚说明。

## 关键步骤
1. 设计并审批视频播放组件与主/渲染进程协作方案。
2. 在 `modules/seedance/manager.py` 落地缩略图生成逻辑，覆盖 ffmpeg 成功/失败回退，补充单/集成测试。
3. 对齐导出与存储策略，提供用户操作指引与日志。
4. 执行 Electron 打包 PoC，输出构建脚本、产物与报告。
5. 跑通测试矩阵（播放器操作、缩略图生成、双跑回归、打包冒烟），整理审批材料。

## 注意事项
- 布局锁定仍生效，前端改动限于逻辑与状态。
- ffmpeg 依赖需可检测并给出回退提示，必要时随包携带或引导安装。
- Qt 链路保留作为回滚通道；所有关键节点需更新 Serena 记忆与审批材料。

## 目标
- 在 Electron 验证通过后，启动正式迁移工作，覆盖前端架构、后端 API、任务调度、视频链路、打包与监控体系。
- 保持 Qt 体系作为回滚方案；执行期间禁止修改现有 Qt 代码，除非用于比较或紧急修复。

## 主要任务
1. **前端架构落地**（React + TS + Zustand/Redux Toolkit）：建立基础工程、组件规范、核心模块原型。
2. **后端 API 归一化**：整理 Python 服务接口，统一请求/响应格式与错误码。
3. **任务调度与 Schema 表单选型**：比较 Formily/JSON Forms，设计 IPC 与任务管理策略。
4. **视频链路补全**：验证视频播放、缩略图、导出、日志链路在 Electron 下的实现。
5. **打包与多平台验证**：构建打包流程（含签名）、自动更新、安全策略、多平台冒烟测试。
6. **性能与监控体系**：搭建前端性能/错误监控，扩展 CI/CD 流程覆盖测试与发布。

## 里程碑
- M4-1：前端工程基础与组件规范完成。
- M4-2：后端 API 归一化方案与 PoC 通过。
- M4-3：任务调度与 Schema 表单选型确定并完成 PoC。
- M4-4：视频链路与打包流程 PoC 通过。
- M4-5：性能/错误监控与 CI/CD 流水线初版上线。

每个里程碑需：
- 写入 Serena 阶段总结。
- 提交设计/PoC 文档与风险清单。
- 明确回滚方案。

## 审批与依赖
- 阶段 3 总结与技术路线决策已获批准。
- 执行前需审批各项方案（前端栈、API 归一化、任务/表单、视频链路、打包、监控）。
- 资源：前端/后端执行窗口、证书与打包环境、CI/CD 权限。

## 注意事项
- 执行窗口需使用 Serena MCP 工具，遵循 `docs/window_startup_checklist.md`。
- 任何代码迁移前，先完成 PoC 与审批，确保可回滚。
- 若在执行中发现 Electron 无法满足特定能力，立即停止并汇报，等待决策。

## 已完成
- 导出链路基础加固：`modules/repository/export_service.py`、`tools/export_bundle.py` 增强目的地校验、Zip-Slip/路径规范、UTF-8 产物与 `op_id` 日志；`Seedream`/`Seedance` 落盘时补齐 `file_id`/相对路径，`envelope_parser` 扩展 `primary_output` 字段。
- CLI 与 Electron 对齐：`tools/seedream_cli.py` 增加 `list`/`export --json`，`electron/main/ipc/modules/exports.ts` 使用 Zod 校验并统一错误码；任务卡片导出面板落地（缺少 `file_id` 时禁用、错误提示附日志指引）。
- 测试与一致性：新增 `tests/integration/test_export_consistency.py` 校验 CLI ↔ 服务一致性；`npm run lint`、相关 pytest 均通过，手动 `python tools/seedream_cli.py list/export --json` 产物正常。

## 未完成/下一步
- Step D：Electron 打包 PoC（随包 ffmpeg 策略、资源路径适配、签名/公证流程、打包日志）
- Step E：阶段测试矩阵与审批材料整理（播放器/缩略图/导出/双跑/打包冒烟）
- 冻结项目级待办仍待集中排期（双 CSV 索引、快捷键体系等）

INFO  2025-10-17 10:49:20,634 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 阶段 4 - M4-4 执行计划要点（2025-10-18）

## 目标
- 补齐 Electron 视频链路：播放器、缩略图、导出、日志与打包流程。
- 在本阶段实施缩略图策略（ffmpeg 优先 + 首帧回退），并验证依赖与性能。
- 完成 Electron 打包 PoC（mac 主、win 选），形成安全/回滚说明。

## 关键步骤
1. 设计并审批视频播放组件与主/渲染进程协作方案。
2. 在 `modules/seedance/manager.py` 落地缩略图生成逻辑，覆盖 ffmpeg 成功/失败回退，补充单/集成测试。
3. 对齐导出与存储策略，提供用户操作指引与日志。
4. 执行 Electron 打包 PoC，输出构建脚本、产物与报告。
5. 跑通测试矩阵（播放器操作、缩略图生成、双跑回归、打包冒烟），整理审批材料。

## 注意事项
- 布局锁定仍生效，前端改动限于逻辑与状态。
- ffmpeg 依赖需可检测并给出回退提示，必要时随包携带或引导安装。
- Qt 链路保留作为回滚通道；所有关键节点需更新 Serena 记忆与审批材料。

INFO  2025-10-17 10:49:23,487 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 阶段 4 - M4-4 UI 整改总结（2025-10-18）

## 问题概述
- Electron 前端在 dev 模式出现 `getSnapshot should be cached` 与 `Maximum update depth exceeded`，导致界面白屏。
- 根因：体验卡片与 Formily 表单同时写入引用 store，selector 返回新引用；`ReferencePicker` 内部 effect 与 store 写入形成闭环。

## 关键改动
1. **单一真源**：保留 Formily 表单为引用数据唯一写入入口；首页“参考资源体验”卡片改为只读预览，不再调用 controller 更新 store。
2. **ReferencePicker 调整**：取消对全局 store hover 状态的依赖，使用组件内 `useState`；store 写入前增加等值守卫，防止重复更新；Effect 依赖统一通过 `useMemo/useCallback` 缓存。
3. **Zustand 订阅稳定化**：App 任务列表改为原子 selector + `useMemo` 派生，避免生成新引用；引用 controller 中保留 schema 签名守卫。

## 验证
- 体验卡片与表单能正常显示，控制台无循环警告；`npm run lint`、`npm run check:node-imports`、`npx vitest run electron/main/ipc/modules/__tests__/schema.test.ts` 均通过。

## 后续注意
- 后续可安排 Formily Schema 命名迁移（`InputNumber` -> `NumberPicker`）、AntD `variant` 替换与 TypeScript/ESLint 版本告警收口；在 Step D 期间继续保持“单一真源”与“写入前等值守卫”的约束。

- **核心改动**：`utils/video_thumbnail_generator.py` 新增 `generate()`，优先调用 ffmpeg 生成缩略图，失败自动回退至首帧提取；输出标准日志（strategy、took_ms、path）。
- **Seedance Manager**：`_save_video_locally` 整合新策略，记录 `thumbnail_strategy`，并在日志使用 `thumb_summary` 摘要；API 缩略图仍作兜底。
- **配置开关**：`config/settings.py` 支持 `GEMENG_FFMPEG_ENABLED`、`GEMENG_THUMB_TIMEOUT_MS`、`GEMENG_THUMB_SCENE` 环境变量；默认开启 ffmpeg。
- **测试**：新增 `tests/unit/test_video_thumbnail.py` 覆盖 ffmpeg 成功、失败回退与禁用；`tests/integration/test_seedance_thumbnail.py` 验证 `_save_video_locally` 写入缩略图路径与策略。
- **文档**：`docs/planning/stage4_m4-4_stepb_thumbnail_strategy_20251018.md` 追加实施记录，列明日志字段及配置。

- Python：`modules/repository/export_service.py` 封装仓库导出与记录列表；Seedream/Seedance 保存流程补充 `file_id`、`relative_path` 并写入 envelope `primary_output` 与 `storage.local.primary`。
- CLI：`tools/seedream_cli.py` 增加 `list`/`export` 子命令与 `--json` 输出，可供终端与 Electron 复用；导出成功返回 zip/manifest、缺失项统计。
- Electron：新增 `exports:list/bundle/choose-destination` IPC（调用 seedream_cli --json）；渲染层任务卡片加入导出面板按钮，支持默认导出或选择目录，成功后提示目标路径。
- Store/UI：`TaskRecord` 存储 fileId/outputPath/thumbnailPath，任务摘要解析 envelope primary_output；导出面板使用 Ant Design Button + message 反馈。
- 验证：`npm run lint`、`pytest tests/unit/test_video_thumbnail.py tests/integration/test_seedance_thumbnail.py tests/unit/test_envelope_parser.py` 通过；手动执行 `python tools/seedream_cli.py list/export --json` 验证导出产物（zip/manifest）。

INFO  2025-10-17 10:49:40,449 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:task:279 - Result: # 阶段规划：阶段 4（2025-10-10）

## 目标
- 在 Electron 验证通过后，启动正式迁移工作，覆盖前端架构、后端 API、任务调度、视频链路、打包与监控体系。
- 保持 Qt 体系作为回滚方案；执行期间禁止修改现有 Qt 代码，除非用于比较或紧急修复。

## 主要任务
1. **前端架构落地**（React + TS + Zustand/Redux Toolkit）：建立基础工程、组件规范、核心模块原型。
2. **后端 API 归一化**：整理 Python 服务接口，统一请求/响应格式与错误码。
3. **任务调度与 Schema 表单选型**：比较 Formily/JSON Forms，设计 IPC 与任务管理策略。
4. **视频链路补全**：验证视频播放、缩略图、导出、日志链路在 Electron 下的实现。
5. **打包与多平台验证**：构建打包流程（含签名）、自动更新、安全策略、多平台冒烟测试。
6. **性能与监控体系**：搭建前端性能/错误监控，扩展 CI/CD 流程覆盖测试与发布。

## 里程碑
- M4-1：前端工程基础与组件规范完成。
- M4-2：后端 API 归一化方案与 PoC 通过。
- M4-3：任务调度与 Schema 表单选型确定并完成 PoC。
- M4-4：视频链路与打包流程 PoC 通过。
- M4-5：性能/错误监控与 CI/CD 流水线初版上线。

每个里程碑需：
- 写入 Serena 阶段总结。
- 提交设计/PoC 文档与风险清单。
- 明确回滚方案。

## 审批与依赖
- 阶段 3 总结与技术路线决策已获批准。
- 执行前需审批各项方案（前端栈、API 归一化、任务/表单、视频链路、打包、监控）。
- 资源：前端/后端执行窗口、证书与打包环境、CI/CD 权限。

## 注意事项
- 执行窗口需使用 Serena MCP 工具，遵循 `docs/window_startup_checklist.md`。
- 任何代码迁移前，先完成 PoC 与审批，确保可回滚。
- 若在执行中发现 Electron 无法满足特定能力，立即停止并汇报，等待决策。
