视频详情页垂直分割器布局优化\n  - 图片3.x模式上传框\"+\"号几何居中\n  - 自适应布局和初始化优化\n  - 视频页自动加载修复\n  - Seedream 4.0尺寸标准化\n  - 首/尾帧参考图功能验证\n\n### 📦 发布准备\n- **文档完善**：更新所有版本相关文档和发布说明\n- **打包测试**：验证Windows打包流程和应用启动\n- **版本控制**：统一所有模块的版本信息引用\n\n### 🔧 技术改进\n- 版本信息统一管理，所有组件引用单一版本源\n- 打包配置优化，确保依赖完整性\n- 文档结构规范化，便于后续维护\n\n> 🎯 **升级建议**：这是首个正式发布版本，建议所有用户升级到此版本以获得最佳体验和稳定性。\n\n## [0.8.1] - 2025-11-06 \"体验打磨\"\n\n### ✨ 界面与交互\n- 视频详情页左侧改为垂直分割（QSplitter），“视频播放区 + 参考图画廊”上下布局，画廊高度可拖拽调整，浏览体验大幅提升（qt_app.py）。\n- 图片 3.x 模式上传框“+”号始终几何居中：增加内容区内边距与首帧渲染后一次性尺寸计算，避免高 DPI 或首次渲染宽度为 0 导致的偏移（qt_app.py）。\n- 首行边框/第二行无边框样式在视频模式对齐图片模式，整体视觉一致（qt_app.py）。\n\n### 🧠 自适应与稳定性\n- 初始化后触发一次响应式高度计算，确保初次展示即为正确布局（图片模式，qt_app.py）。\n- 修复视频页自动加载逻辑：\n  - 将 `model()` 误用改为访问属性 `model`，消除 “object is not callable” 异常（qt_app.py）。\n  - `VideoHistoryView.load_initial()` 去除不支持的 `page_size` 参数，避免自动加载中断（qt_app.py）。\n  - 非虚拟化分支改为正确引用 `video_waterfall_widget`，修复首次切换目录不加载的情况（qt_app.py）。\n  - 路径切换后的重新加载优先走虚拟化视图：先 `bind_repository()`，再 `load_initial()`，失败时回退瀑布流（qt_app.py）。\n\n### 📐 Seedream 4.0 尺寸标准化\n- 统一移除小边 < 1024 的条目，保留大尺寸 21:9 为 3024×1296；在 4.0 模式对尺寸选项做安全过滤，避免旧项残留（modules/provider/schema.py）。\n\n### 📦 其他\n- 验证“首/尾帧参考图”写入历史记录并在详情页画廊显示的完整链路（modules/seedance/manager.py + qt_app.py）。\n\n> 升级提示：打包前请清理旧的 `dist/`、`build/`，并确认 Windows 方案使用 `gemeng_windows.spec`；首次运行需在设置页配置存储路径与 API Key。\n\n## [0.8.0] - 2025-09-19 \"多源协奏\"\n\n### 🚀 核心升级\n- **Seedream 4.0 全面接入**：Provider/Client 动态选择 Ark `images/generations` 端点，多参考图 payload 统一为 data URL，自动网络回退。\n- **参考图体验重构**：画廊支持自适应列数、同步高亮与预览快捷键，导出控制器统一处理主图 + 参考图打包。\n- **详情页交互升级**：主图/缩略图随窗口伸缩，支持…123 chars truncated…。\n- 多参考图导出附带 `_refNN` 清单与 JSON/CSV 元数据，日志摘要脱敏记录 provider/endpoint。\n- 预览窗口新增缺图提醒、左右按钮与键盘快捷键，操作一致性显著提升。\n\n### 🧪 自测\n- `python3 -m compileall gemeng`\n- `python3 tests/self_checks/ui_schema_smoke.py`\n- 桌面端场景验证：Seedream v3/v4 文/图生图、多参考图生成、详情页导出、快捷键关闭全部通过。\n\n## [0.7.0] -

I’ll also check the tags for clarity."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpWdAaEaTfCyq7NSrG-f6F9JusW0JQaD--p8pC1iCy6Pl78L87A04Pxw5TTT2t5MV2fa9wLdb6D2dkVp9L_aPmEj9KxT4TwHT3PALWUKy8tDU8DwHBOA9tjw3rczuqrmyZysZNt_oDfl7kjQlntkux3vCxlSu_n_6YkWvTZwgkVqV1XVo0ZB1dcTF0HeYbSMuZ9Nxuo8T0uMx-u30pkQOn4qtKGkFNIAyCcoTmp9qNfZ8SIVVoHrmRsbj2jUm1TTKfltTQCmNZFI0yTvHYhFpCAlQAH3V1q42wlVyaTUq25zi56UKplZjccujK7Q3Hoot3VpOeR15uJdZMd2DW2nXEUGO0h9AkBBOWm0gkxHEo10kZ1cPzRe_SgKnlG8Q_DWuN0SSq11buqplhaZQHVEBATH_ifh32-FcI99GSn2x4BqXcRtkLVjRMaNAWPPjWVPzt1K6jEd4s1kTJIGRJEX_8sjo5qCFq79Yp2UpAISulWDhnXIy_vFpX_P17zRDqfBPlr5Pdyg-Ew3afQTTYv2AMXewjoz50zt9cuV3UzxdwxZ3_MHAohN6zHP1DP-qCFJXmjDm3_QKv89AzU7LY2-yj2a6D6CJJ1JsVWI5CWpg-x-8dIpkgGAhqUg3n_XZ1nTBJ6Hy4p_4j2zPgffweFwatrU1el_9j-z4GVy61KHg8Mhcu7kwBXhMj2K91HZO9nuLkse03cKox5jPRKHEzY0SKyRLfifNBc7X31hYqThewdivRi3Nj1tTP3FMYjtyrnH5k56wOfjZ7dGZzyreyfvPwFlyVp9KgJnfy-iS3iLVuJc2JwxeSvplOcEZWqCT5lh0uuz7oHX2SCn9S3PyXkgDD7TM8HeWAsVpjbl4XJEfiFmMS9j-GaNQL36w2jf_NHJtYzjcSwBOqMXcCfBvIqQxwzebKGU9MtG3mB-VgfKkCgOWwqK4jjalYoPlWIc3ShkC4GeDexdPgZh_IoivHkdyB5le6xOqizYCyb8rw240hau3ySJkU0jJB0wuVq3hatRukDfVmqzLvD2ys_gETO25In2gSP6JbFgSDM3DTwWr6krUQYD89DLkJFpqjdRHMNsC308b9jVDLMUYlld8DeD-7xpDDQYWMAc3kBlfcq-2XUBj-wTi79f4LZZkHlozFItrC2HEKMTzUaobsj6AAnxISskAFRomQVVwujVNzqxcNxM9sD-Hcrb7vUxpwEq00q6XFQEgXuYsDL62ks7YbQLPUoc5vKGv_h_RDnd-ByAcq8_nJXOFhzCukLzUH0l340M9AbM-T9liIZC8o9pRZpDJWt77vfoGrfBXUX-vRAr_gXZnDny5cp8-SRekX1gtm4cce4to29Y7_1pBsLd5WTogWW7o2o1rNhGHdo_Z0xS1gW8OQTO7_vAzJmrZPI6AmTCtBdVwbpIdWxrcIcrkMLdYJNBn-ikl7i9txpXuHHj5Ysa3IRJO2DOcDHhMNDwfgfhLitCadQECDN8iGRybleTllxnFKf3sEPeihiLCJ7CeiXiml6RkMw5AYVmNf8o-3zoojYbbdUk06DBUlSdc2nd27dI9sAZgpABcl2EwtAAjFJoJov2po3hHHuIDuH-P34vt_zGsekmkpJQo71xA21KXM-4CdJwCjEoFeUtNig6fjNLB2GRKkaqt3Z6QCSh6PuJiXDQK6WGSmzlQIVk-VhoIFS9Rf7R3XjFjqiqXRNtsXIIE-brdsSPVxnOUoSjCcsz7q_F98hIuWIIM3cxk0FtBEhBtr47kOli6GSUxDSZKCqkVpG_oHlTBNyYrhn60-AkZG7CYaytA3QyFNIWdr6PoG7__RoyZ9hpb3efVnifhEKmqkE6XwCR-WE7IxWr3Uat3meWq1NBXiyIMIHBSLzGvmzqkIzIswfL_YUCeN4ZqnqD1IFISlJH6CwCelQK6Kigc0fS-49UToQmtXsH8nF2W20r4wvv-js7P7o0v_ctoPL8HFIM1zftKynJtWnCnid-8w59jbQAqaIREeq-YaO3udjzVndODvuCGKgLxh-0nThly1T2Ny7LhKNc9Z40mdFBx6CupLtrs5iGAc7WiNAeywqMkENRx8J1CAQ9IXRW9GsyqAnHZEQ-jRKwbaVl6m_eo6zxLEKElhNeUDAymYASnUndSbKirIU988VoOmyHHlbWEgco8Bu3Vjl5G1mAK2IV5nC5VKGfXSixavb8fxfUIE-hzRDJ6No4dGBgA0w8iImAPGUoq8OIClXqahTpIYdmVGKa6dXF45eh1OLQPFRh7cXF8t4XWfvZ7JFwP4kQSlF9qWNTNpFgMdeyclWqswNWHrXhxQRr6j3B7aX6sFq7V0wKhNLUYhvkAYf_W7Ok4F51-nSOM9L7LpjJ6QfDgRANIaTL6KXlfbEQAfOHrJQe5KQp-7wwVfEgcEMGcD1n5V-7yAwOeTsnRd9q_nRXfJEoqaG5J5lhgRzW1s3gVmsoUinpq48P6nsmw9x6N06b5YFkncInTE7KYYzu4RizlW_kWBO60V5v5j8Gub0h8TYHt--KZK-i5Pw2Iv2tDO1TZriZ9PET-B-seHvfkeocv6Y_4UmtRIixo4egYW-NFVpFSmdGloreudf1oXkmFZz1wLyMglV_WLYTauoD8ot3W5PiiQVWYz0c4tktQiGwnXuqdAg0Z4exZYIsNRpQOFoE6ScaCEGRrFpi20ylqmBh1paeUhuRefpcjSrnNNzJArvwhRvayJBWw4EzE1cCYZujfci5POX-EbRe37itHDr-4j10Fm7gQ9lj11rxdCGbvbjojkLOLqbmdMjvtH7mL4fct1YMz-SNi5VUfZBoh1xj4P9SZtKForXPBUtbmKl9I9BjrugR2hnpqQLe-2yMcp4PBJhLyQNKOHclHGvFvu1mUMBgvgLmQU-AaERFqUw7fldUB763A7JEv26m2o9aZnL5dgP6iGJMEX99V6RWjzk2JSN_t-jeL-6DFhMeDNHUoxxjkCxuWiKU4AVCbjaC_YIJTWnPDhTTqzjv9K36CrUwf5P06W1Wi4hyUafqPC6JoHQFOq4h3zcGR8QKCGPjQSG3TfjyOKgrKm6lhH9OrvAT8o0SVxT2rvWZ24OMlzpwhE02C7dIp94ZH1VLjVBarHP4MuSgAzcwHAj8Fv8vAfBOXuOcknoMKfVUYbV4BS-PJU6gqTY9AeOxfH6KsWfEtuDnOgvGzX7pisLWlqbx8d1GN-Tt0Qx45t7-qgrPGudeSeXADX3kYKqA4vWBZRqTX82_ALS7hOhv6QAazctCm81TqvL6eW-2TsKh3C-QK6CcsT62MPcOYB8yMliYO53RiUsgQB_F3pw41V6AuKXY4kiblDhZP871PAAm52wEAHFa_oqioq_dwbV1SpbEWWhWR7lbT5Q_Oaba55L9XnHSQTqMRPEoDsWlrRNHUX0HzxcfGbdTtdzVvvaCH6qf4EhXZUhYgxIkCCR7WCGzg0CwJRjzIZZYkebkpqjYPVgLKDMJwdCS2zm7LLg-e_F-XtqfMhs7-BpL__oJNMRjCPCEyecLbWEbg-xhA4CuJ2tTR8mP6k_44zGD2Do8SQeombGDmBpizxDWmRMMl00bKy7DmKCa06-oX2og-HI3g6fZ2EDIgq01_BBbF9MvN-T-0QaybqOrYUjL_gpzPkkuu3CJQ8xjGxigKwMsNtnhngLU8AilT_C5qUIs4advfzIetwUGu8VmH3eXbYWKlTX9Khor5sK8FNrrTV1wlo4bs-wYUtUTPLGO7Ko2jXAES19ph4FS3YtPg81EAhH275eQbRiaXoKh4s-OV6FNpAcyrnibMnGBi1YkARv8vXSKWrqPXWTwdWS4sDKH8U3xsoXNlkwFSRK9WiTFtWXgOyY8rRVCg-JFpVa5e4L9ZwjEw1uNGsScDTux6lDDRdoVI4DKw88luoHe34bsY-Nux4FIS7puZ7R0cP5h6QtZVvqZMArjebs8cVQW-xlKWTu-pc0nG2uo0PsfuwIS3J2HdpdQYxzOZBnZGI5OlStedWUuA6uFHaskdB_rlzgrdlaD-yvMRe8UrFRLHbVNFtMmNsjTfCeB1XBDLMfJ4hFN0FqngB3KyufCzfUszg8KlXOjnv3MsmxxdCUOVdLuO0ONYBj4AgJHINDkl35XsikFeCmrYXqXAwLsNDqsvdVheDxsX_EiA3WEcAdw0zE6VzJYtatgV8Zku1d6JkK7FksfJ899TPSCQdS2f_qvg2oTj-Wxbh8a51bpoexLEzXYMWJWFG04ZowqyO1TmkJ5ruBNMcVPQ8QxLSwoHWSv3x-8dzV62WIMEIgs0WRSRYpVvzEONLF7UFP4dfswLa3hSFWTuoFBs-Jj-8XOITGDIWbEVHH4Heq1tnTLlPWQPWfEkXUOV8IfjBvEZ4aDzD_KQfLlRFylWwrpIqt9pDfKm9rei6iLcyg4aGS6Z3V-LGyW2W4VxIwj7KOBHt5i-4HhWZ8DB1-RgyrAMmIv2zXcucA70jO4M="}}

I’ll check the commit date for “release: v1.4.0” (2025-12-13) to possibly find the date for v1.4.1 as well."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpWdDLrk9uUYkgv2mKlvjb0vsYdU-CeO8Ghok7wApMA29RUs9jCB-KjcB10yKObq1JIUkgv2bRAOqRiDu2fweyDUgY95q7P8OX9lh7lOcBE6ram1fmridWMAbL8WsjDmPnT6xiS5-v8NKd3QuaXp5BlpBdPaLQhG0-CV25OgBAzsxcztRgPOyVWzVwFUwcRFfAyKsFvNuFsq4F0LERZxXqimoPAgbiZuEJacBQ0PamLMU2pKhMeZZB4OSduv2ijGXXQVmiib-GX6GzS-9_MUXFW7M8uhL5JeR7QI_0Kx64xCjk-_9yCBoppabcv1tYukmI7ewDrkKrHTKl5rlMnJ2ixxLgLqXo7wASnsGQguKj2f7UGa4ZLV8hTvEkbixtRGYRdpCCxRd4IrG0mN7nBezjjh04Hm8ub4Smx9XKi3JLRCODcfbmiiuWgR75S_SA9xp2K-LQ191wLX2FZOhL2HPBy0VlN3Ks0pC116TLSlJ35LDqpazkvuYpeLdaG-FRSb2l18E-qxs_kimX6mFoxCI6tSyDkIjSC7JzjRP6PEwjyrGuSWUWsVxDV58wbqRtuiMAG6lKrecgZGaa6xlehgcQMW-U95l6cvRNJp3_CO1uqcTFt5AGPiwAjAobiZFSw8xL2Il7QjUF_ZSGnNPaFnbsfLv1crbGFd91DRDtsGNdTZIQybv5jT6RJTba7IaJUstusUAOs407_gwiWIrYbO5qRL5QbZeOoz-QRcz5puofZtrEmuTsjPpikTz_rnQT6GEGg76yOMOclE5ZU7uInaIGzD68cWrofq2K7E_1TqHb1LB4JilB91yAyeWPVi8fJk1L1ZMaUzO9m_vG5hUBywu1O4dIGC0_7x5z_6mdxk3MfCrlaXOWVt-leCXniKKBPNrgVxsUdyjAJGdLGd7kyfEYdz1Jej8CXsIWiBRZ-UWIEuCCS8nrRLGNjnRFJpM33eX9kQAScbbxxrL3kl3hq9wML2r6KbymxiMwxpER-w_TPnO1AXXTX4ys1fq_nyYnr6ZfkBJZHX3CC8OproyA0vu5Mqf5VDen_HeTqjJwaNsdDwRdjtrZ6W886J8nQ-2d8f_LpXC-RK8hzH7rhwb9_Pqo2_mjWABQG0BJiNfhP557T-X5PmoJUzBfzvY75IOMZrgsxSk2oyHsVV-rMe3oZBC18dg95wj-Bj7q4EIbBMpZnZHN7Gzn3b-ly0jhQakzje6v0TsU-ysjjV9OvP6pAmfbgPLqLg_WSCdzmaBjc6mWyERdTtwX0PtTqXangSZAUxtAeBkKFkZtGFVL3bTAE2pCPw5B8X-fcQw_aTHRFm7gmsgHZqP7Gb9n6mJs6MuDBu7sVmbowrhtLYriiKayaHTUcM0HVDzEHEyurAFG_V2iYWMHceuOFgB9ZKp87lA_iVk5_8ouQt9ITT_6yjOOwtsWlEfz2SDWiAZRbgUarAyF_D73WxqT7JfwlLJTfxCOp72JUU7QILfIXMZA3qh7LHlTc5ert1GiAY23S-H28p7BDqJYeGyMA4whEl61IkUgRn9AnkW9m4bLYwf8W3_Ue6Bqrq5CK6qB5XI-l9UNo7CJaQjjD6kum-foWRcMNz8c-_L-QnNgD9zTSZOZU0zgQgP_EIAISwYeC1GGfLMkCdQVIE6qVjhEIlagCcUNtSKmVPdTUbgKhTg2z0YwO67LJIaB5tWDD0BAXCvrm1NJ_wNjLCoYxoD__hAWmG9Tq1WoRV3hy46DYojD4SFZmhT6dO89RA21CHolXBgA0pFu6iTX-1JMbdYtc-ovRPON1kXU68JvyUkAyD7WCltrVW47Ftoqmq4zAA51PU_7X7Nc85Yqbw8tThZuaUvURQ_LXnLlUl0LuGg90GWFNeT1JyTjKNNmDI9YUk3yr3CfLa8lL2rZqz-eN1Kb8AcBElNt32XewjNtx6r5T3lsM4av6TNtGXuV7H7wkcPwGCXXZ8hIAFTcT-zlskPBC2rCysdFDhyVxMSXG4m1cYKBlx1wdDmU9w3dyBft13FpHL2pB8yDx4wLfRo69JVQxhB05rj4yj1InLx9iWKbBbzGBReC6jjBaUY57vqz-5HOTb0AfqMAu_ELIYJd363rCxBheL63j6rEYyy5rkGSjt68GqN5iVPK32UXv5jF7UqwlNFcaT-xVZezcEWQ2lNGYAFCb7Oa6RL3W9oy9GhosSXMjOUnq3OtnyHlmgwv2cgJ4Z9pQIYGdVXB7ePIYfTGAWaCZ-H41P8L3p0_39ZjLG_ejBZX6Jr2h1rZ2O9-yLnBEneWoTpkjAveni9duvYiFdOXyelX_xIcmrK2iGe95X93YTXTsznOZNvOScQ3o0eVMSnlWRI1nsSiYtZL9sNtmYXwPwcZ3HcaombSCETRXd-UHgduV4sMudVYS5tKRZ2pRACG4ccflZ82oEJj5xAPXT9QotzBhUPgZmnv96ruRFieWBoFAeCRY2KFNFh2W0VkbD4KZE6ATVYwwLrZZqJUPB-ABfoyjx3ZAgoBjktOfPaqEupRMAzP_MLG77_SyHG3IyzUwvhspLTu-8oaXMvNiPHwRR483bD6xlhNfMKCLhwvJZ5Bn6-oveL4oD9PYaUbXoCyzynXoEegMw-6pUhWiOheIBsLzvgWQWLdJmTNtit232p15iFoG1ssQWMORLmNCgXq6W5NZDNquzjThucH2ujEUzs_rsIP9zE9YPpl77hO_OjmCDMPzq7G0h-5ihgQ2YqxqIkTrRDy-j79zaqrRCJyxbzJHNRvQCpRtV3teiOSmLpYdXgNEwfMLZ6PTmIAfuuStbXYTuI7TU5q450="}}

2025-11-26 \"macOS 正式版\"\n\n### 🍎 macOS 平台支持\n- **首个 macOS 正式版**：基于 PyInstaller 打包的原生 .app 应用\n- **Apple Silicon 支持**：完整支持 M1/M2/M3 系列处理器\n- **高清图标**：3840x3840 分辨率正式版图标\n\n### 🐛 关键修复\n- **批量生成模型降级修复**：\n  - 问题：选择 Seedream 4.0 + 4096x4096 时，批量生成实际使用 3.0 模型\n  - 原因：`concurrent_generate_text_to_image` 方法缺少 `model_variant` 参数传递\n  - 影响文件：`modules/seedream/manager.py`, `services/image_service.py`\n\n- **API Key ASCII 验证**：\n  - 新增 API Key 格式检查，防止配置文件污染导致 latin-1 编码错误\n  - 影响文件：`modules/seedream/client.py`, `modules/seedance/client.py`\n\n### 📦 打包优化\n- 添加 urllib3 hiddenimports 解决打包后的 HTTP 编码问题\n- 添加 runtime hook 处理配置模块别名\n- 添加图标生成脚本 `generate_official_icon.sh`\n\n### 📚 文档完善\n- 新增 `docs/macos/README.md` - Mac 版本使用指南\n- 新增 `docs/macos/BUILD_GUIDE.md` - 打包详细指南\n- 新增 `docs/macos/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - 问题排查手册\n\n### ⚠️ 已知问题\n- 应用未经 Apple 公证，首次运行需在系统设置中允许\n- 建议使用 `xattr -cr` 命令清除扩展属性后运行\n\n> 🎯 **升级建议**：使用 macOS 的用户应升级到此版本以获得完整的 4.0 模型支持和批量生成功能。\n\n---\n\n## [1.0.1] -

视频详情页垂直分割器布局优化\n  - 图片3.x模式上传框\"+\"号几何居中\n  - 自适应布局和初始化优化\n  - 视频页自动加载修复\n  - Seedream 4.0尺寸标准化\n  - 首/尾帧参考图功能验证\n\n### 📦 发布准备\n- **文档完善**：更新所有版本相关文档和发布说明\n- **打包测试**：验证Windows打包流程和应用启动\n- **版本控制**：统一所有模块的版本信息引用\n\n### 🔧 技术改进\n- 版本信息统一管理，所有组件引用单一版本源\n- 打包配置优化，确保依赖完整性\n- 文档结构规范化，便于后续维护\n\n> 🎯 **升级建议**：这是首个正式发布版本，建议所有用户升级到此版本以获得最佳体验和稳定性。\n\n## [0.8.1] - 2025-11-06 \"体验打磨\"\n\n### ✨ 界面与交互\n- 视频详情页左侧改为垂直分割（QSplitter），“视频播放区 + 参考图画廊”上下布局，画廊高度可拖拽调整，浏览体验大幅提升（qt_app.py）。\n- 图片 3.x 模式上传框“+”号始终几何居中：增加内容区内边距与首帧渲染后一次性尺寸计算，避免高 DPI 或首次渲染宽度为 0 导致的偏移（qt_app.py）。\n- 首行边框/第二行无边框样式在视频模式对齐图片模式，整体视觉一致（qt_app.py）。\n\n### 🧠 自适应与稳定性\n- 初始化后触发一次响应式高度计算，确保初次展示即为正确布局（图片模式，qt_app.py）。\n- 修复视频页自动加载逻辑：\n  -

To confirm v1.4.0’s commit date, we've previously noted it as 2025-12-13."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpWdIv2-xBYGZ-c4Uh215DLeyt4IKt_IMNlbaJ0Nz9-oFhAv0B9Ww4ifTvWgp2R9pXuVVmvq8ulLMv4LfdolioaZE8XyJ4FpzwM-M87a49v1jsna1P6a2zNnPBLVHst_RQMrcaRtCANO7AFTj7pws0w4gr0DPijsfWYZMz9WqmY6z4yX0--vqZxg-lS3gzWLiqh1F9ng-UtsvYRGPLMo5uEt8W0jlobHpdCNwwLfToM7r7vYYI7hzaGjD_94pmmU1PuLyHwt16Doeuw0CnslrmSa4pVUm2hULj_eCKS8GPgJ8Ww-zDV-6ZKYGq5-0J0XfZg4X2Eecx7IY2ju6HvBOjtsrw7SVQ5EVvTEo5medoltUDNeRVDe5FFhF_sy5JIxStsHGmO6p0IS9lRlKTezvM9sur2dLlcHmrv3SqiLXy2vgwO5Y-1tnOaKKbr1odgTYqunm_wA-SToGF73V1E751hPuP9uZsEypu3_qGLszXAoKH58vSF2h_WMEDFpBPbLOci9i-yGgq8njLjReETxsU_7R_zRkhCMIsOJymYTw1OmnyWrdmD2wI1Lma3ipcdZS73b2AL0cxdu6gMTETmLXesk-EimyJ3nYHgE1F-HLpn2PI4xLHekkm71qjNeY2PgTnuSZ3uVMI6jkTeiDXIGGxrCNKUHb9pZqT2rwFAlLWVgVvrWWm-RIPRtbiPX5cj5CZ5xYj0HPmQWCd2uqkxfS86t7jM-DMekWetMnTKVdgc-53sNLP0USE-PXcPQ6EZrm45O-nH5nIAxiB4zwIBzE5ngC9dDILBY20rLZ_HgYNDIheMyd2L-VchL5ek8pnk2nNTeFxNM0C2BS6X3HbLm7IcuAl78eJ4DzJcSOu8Neci0iMRi8tvP0Pd5K-FpvP2t1W6TYNT6jKPTrCdWHI97vZ88k5lVsN1W4cjKQua0lDj4X5PCa3oHA5QIV2DX0TLPv5aqTn_uxm7DQms_iTjE0iChtMX1CwuwOSnjqcW-y6CVRJR-8RjDGlGKHFwHOZALHwE2GP1ZgKvQHCgAYM_NcrjYuZuq_488pY8onerLoM9DwWRy0IdLKD4trLn4FdxbyI6u_osAqLgsBv6K0teA4yHizqFhCYo3GaSFPrKE_Z8CPz8LaVZjNtxSyp5Lwwlyn7MhaH1Y8gHp_zHQi1jkhvqBi_Z0PCCG76Q7QjeBbi1vewqxpi3SGy3qoOvJ0ehTVxQMOtkRXEpf4-eGX1_49CEiZIZ4MutGkftBWknzO2pG8sX2D_ueki4andNb7DaJHAchSidUmb2qctxM7bnidSDd2KFj7xu_7BMK7g0xSf26abaj1l4TR24Pn4UjsHWU0S_rQc7EpxFy1a9zxPrDIqfYm07MIPnGXDhIzZXPKgci2-nYv-5ZVWxlR-jiVPv1QiN9JPq7_yGjL2U3-HkZM4rWR-L1q622hfppBL5b709x0aV3RfCEBrEdHQLkmDieWvrpdVWs9sm5sPTXGT9SJNYgMFopJTaGZd_Gr9MG911yIyfGrQfPMbxQ0SNKLak8R1V-tMXEzVzYop2ZWPrp_1wS1P8b3J0QNDHNjmwXU2eer-JEUI4gLioZkCGwLBSgdSQg-hwItj5JbNLaNkEZdKalvHP9Po2Fwi9CDLJpKk0cXtqwpUh76b6jQlC_-l2GQ5VeluYp8fDNW8NYIS2b1KNDQxDmjJ97UbF0RXvYIXu2Q1r6LBFgIAqkBYA4bhIenEc11K56zWVQlaDxdzSLOAm1zwB4Y9haf_mYshqkE1FWYGbkz-5jiNXfVCnIkbtCjHQ9418ec8vxr2zKUlM_x9JTzi1IiH_nCxvQUKT9DdRPE0ZE6dFxsddYlQvz1Gqo9gHH9VlfQZnozV_PrpKlFYvE0TX1e7bIx2Ty6vmFMftfUCqbzlhu6veeM0_h4H9R6R81cxlKJ5FUoMTejPNEPHM5257y6p7upqQVr3v1N3pp-PFalMeSf-8L3LVTBIuGE93hfTunAYjFWK7OyX6hz3ogRi_p3DJN28bk8tH4byX_lAGrQoK2hTKH84BJhjFsSazFMe4OGE1vK3_B4v1uUWRIorWXuzmc5BkbxyF776ypInfk9YIlD_7FciZEcq63bLTXgnsM1HcHCXg7wZNnH80Ie87QNHebG1aGDcm7ofwfkh-agwak1tZtmac1Cg0OjbejBmmRt7CnT9q4VvNg_4DgoWbCA1y61f9S_1WFInocRFVZujuaRJ6Z4K6CDsmczSzXKfKG-cdCjbAi3CSoKYxxIPXoXVVzTNyk7gwxYv4OUaJKn6Ak_FjJakWZnpjtFRohyUG8ZltmkhlO3578dqOHkRFCvtgvVDPG_YMNYjPIVP5XvUCV3OteCV70hYsBTkd_eJWPb9bHZOUjdCR1dxogiiPDoCJELJVRZFAMdHFBGq_m9f8MRzVADDP7JsqXf3EQ05_z4RmDLiDheE1l33ypnXMD4TJmsISeASZBPsDbHg7Q57iRSDIcMNbzuz_yahew85s90vGBy567PYXp4dJco5uWFemtzDckbqTsvnPxfgkgZvmXnXNhP2h98Vhde566GA9HQqB7DaoWrF5m249eXIHzTTI_gVJgM03zwHL6tP5Eg3hKjTgWGxXCq_VUeVFip_X2a0B2eQR0AUI8N-iFkMod8JgnLj4bJmE9PofhbYipjtJGqfQTW9qJj_RwaCHB7p4Ags-Gb8hl4BU9gcuGM4lG_uSTJZNOKibAmDMjVlT1rt8nGYjPaTqLOdlO-hLF1i9mYRPVAwp_4BXoDOQOrHGVidtCjmvJl1UDWYS6A-YLtuxn3YYYyGqcseNGA6BC6RkOTFIu7Fqijzb9ZMmoG3jbHlVwS5QsJVpkf_tVFEL0Gkb-BQZSQcnEVBwkEprqDU6velHqmiMT8m77wiJDIP_-TzxfNeKlUINZ36hnvaRvFkoR8MgVpmapQV2d86KHoJhEi57v0OX64Pfpe_ft7llOxOGlhP2HOgtrayfn9vKN8hel1lBNDOnTqOzTAQFf6sNGPohUk6TCGKs894gf6V11NZ54a-TvUU_KIF21cZpNH30OFOIGtUHg0w3zfwmJcyJAFFbbLoENaG5ayDwFb6LUA-5poxuw66l-RVhTLzlnlcvxGxcHexvFlN8rQNTWj91IQrQhw00lMMhsjjzRnHB-XruxUwYVYmnCMXAI4d7UWN7kUGterWqmyaisxdvvKb767SSDrHaNwuskk7V7tBsw=="}}

I see that “v0.1.9-backup” is more of a backup than a release version. It might be clearer to phrase it as \"v0.1.9-backup（同 v0.1.9，备份tag）\" or not include it at all. I should exclude tags for backups or checkpoints if they don’t start with \"v\". I’ll focus on listing the actual version tags, like `v0.*` and `v1.*`, while noting some specific versions like `v1.2.1`."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Creating a timeline entry**\n\nI’m working on the timeline and considering how to label the transition from prototype to beta version. I think I’ll document it as \"**2025-08 (原型到 Beta)**,\" but I’m not sure if that’s the right phrasing. There could be other labels to consider, but this seems straightforward.

It includes everything from `v0.0.1` to `v0.6.0`, detailing features, improvements, and fixes. I need to be cautious, though, as versions like `v0.4.1`, `v0.5.5`, and `v0.6.0` are actually documentation records, so I should clarify that they aren’t tags.

Now, for September 2025, we have `v0.7.0` with architecture optimizations and performance improvements on the third to fifth. I'll also mention that `v0.8.0` has several new features and a tag commit date of September 20. As for October, `v1.0.0` marks the formal release version with support for image/video generation and reference management.

While keeping it concise, the user likely wants more narrative detail for marketing purposes.\n\nI'll focus on an information-dense summary with a structured timeline, providing enough content to show clients what we've accomplished. Aiming for a 1-2 page summary sounds reasonable, around 50 lines."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Adapting to user requests**\n\nSince oververbosity level 1 means minimal wording, I think adapting to the user's request for a marketing timeline is essential.

{"timestamp":"2026-01-04T03:29:15.930Z","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"reasoning","summary":[{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Organizing milestone events**\n\nThe user wants me to pick 20 milestone events for an article, along with their version update records. I think grouping early minor versions into larger milestones will work. Each bullet point should be concise, ideally just one sentence. I’ll aim to produce 20 items, including the date and version for each. Let’s get creative and informative while keeping it streamlined!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Identifying milestone categories**\n\nI'm breaking down potential milestone categories for the user. We have multi-model support, reference image management, asset management with relative paths, and improvements in history browsing performance. UI improvements like responsive layouts and stability features are also key. Data storage will transition from CSV to SQLite. Additionally, there are updates for video details and settings management with an API key. Cross-platform compatibility for macOS and Windows is essential, with specific user feedback to include. This plan is shaping up nicely!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Preparing the project overview**\n\nI’m incorporating the intro statement, \"我们不是软件公司，我们是AI视觉创意公司。鸽梦来自生产一线痛点：多模型、多参考图、海量历史资产、跨平台、稳定生成。” Then I’ll create a timeline with 20 bullet points, formatted consistently with dates and versions, stating user value milestones. Since we don’t need online tools, I'll summarize the local repo using the existing information. I'll carefully select and enumerate the events for a polished and concise output in plain text with bullet lists. This plan is coming together nicely!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Detailing the version milestones**\n\nI’m documenting specific version milestones with concise entries. For example, on 2025.07.23, version 0.0.1 marks the self-developed start with a unified parameter list for images and videos. Moving to 2025.08.18, version 0.0.3 indicates the first stable image generation is ready. Other milestones through v0.1.5 focus on organized assets, video validation, and repository features for easier access. On 2025.08.22, there’s a desktop app for seamless image/video generation. Lastly, on 2025.08.25, custom size options enhance the UI for production. This is shaping up well!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Refining the milestone timeline**\n\nI’m restructuring the timeline of version milestones to highlight user value and key features. I'll include significant updates like the transition from CSV to SQLite and cross-platform compatibility, as well as improvements in video generation and user interface.

This means mixing earlier foundational features with later significant updates to present a complete picture for the user!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Revising WeChat milestones**\n\nI'm focusing on summarizing the development timeline for WeChat. The user wants 20 distinct milestones, so I need to include both earlier foundational aspects and more recent major features covering up to version 1.7.5. I should emphasize user value rather than minor features, which might mean condensing some earlier versions. I’m also considering merging related updates to keep the list concise while ensuring each entry highlights significant advancements like stability, cross-platform functionality, and improved user experience. I want this to be clear and user-friendly!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Finalizing WeChat milestones**\n\nI’m organizing the timeline for WeChat and combining features to create a clear list of 20 milestones. Items like the infinite scroll and dynamic columns can be merged for efficiency, emphasizing user value. For example, I’ll include the integration of Seedream 4.0 and multi-reference workflows as separate entries. I need to drop some earlier versions that are less critical, like the early video storage validation, but I want to ensure each entry conveys meaningful improvements for the user experience. Let's finalize this list!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Refining WeChat milestones**\n\nI'm organizing the final list of features while ensuring we keep it user-focused.

It seems useful to provide a bullet list summarizing these updates, keeping the entries concise with dates and user value. \n\nI could present it as \"User-visible updates for December\" and include brief notes on each version, highlighting major changes like the new theme system, bug fixes, and improvements to installation experiences."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Considering packaging and user value**\n\nThe user mentioned that packaging automation isn't a concern, but maybe if code signing for macOS reduces Gatekeeper issues, there could be some value to users. I need to confirm whether version 1.7.5 includes code signing, as the tag mentions support for both official and trial builds with this feature, which may help avoid installation blocks on macOS. I should phrase updates carefully, emphasizing smoother installation experiences while being cautious not to oversell claims about approvals. \n\nAdditionally, the user wants to see records, and I can update the last 20 lines to include December features by replacing less valuable items from earlier entries."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Updating the poster list**\n\nThe user hasn’t directly asked for a revised list, but they seem to want an updated version that includes December features for their WeChat article. Since they previously requested a 20-line list and confirmed that December might be missing, I’ll propose, “Yes, here are the user-visible updates from December. I suggest replacing some less significant points from the earlier list with December entries.” \n\nI’ll create a concise 20-line list, each with 12-18 Chinese characters, ensuring it includes key features from June to December."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Finalizing update milestones**\n\nI've compiled the updates into a 20-bullet list while ensuring each line is concise. I merged some sections to fit the count while maintaining user value. Each bullet covers significant features and enhancements, like \"Seedream 4.0\" integration and task recovery for the upcoming version. \n\nBut, I noticed I still need to include cross-platform compatibility updates. Maybe I can refine the structure further to highlight that. It's critical to ensure the most relevant changes are visible!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Finalizing the update**\n\nI need to include December records in the final list since the user specifically asked about them. The focus on v1.4.0 through v1.7.1 will be important as they highlight user-visible features, such as theme switching within v1.5.0. \n\nI think I’ll combine some earlier bullets to fit everything while prioritizing user value! For instance, merging items like v0.0.61 and v0.0.7 into one bullet. This way, I can add features that enhance the user experience while keeping to the limit of 20 lines.
